    Website for my graphic novel series

I am a web developer by day and a comic artist by night. 
My current home for my pet project ["Morphic"](https://mcrice123.github.io/morphic/)
is built using Hugo. 

I love generating my site 
without needing a database or server and I like how easy 
it is to work with Go. However, as a **front end developer**
who worked with **React** for a few years, I want to show off 
my knowledge and skills using this popular JavaScript library.

[GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) is a static site generator 
using [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/). I am excited to create 
a new home for my hobby with all the benefits of my current site and React!
