<h3>
    Website for my graphic novel series
</h3>

I am a web developer by day and a comic artist by night. 
My current home for my pet project ["Morphic"](https://cocky-goldwasser-cbfcf1.netlify.app/) (repository [here](https://github.com/mcrice123/morphic))is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). 

I love generating my site without needing a database or server and I like how easy it is to work with Go. 
However, as a **front end developer** with experience using React, I want to show off my knowledge and skills using this popular JavaScript library.

[GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) is a static site generator using [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/). I am excited to create a new home for my comic with all the benefits of my current site and React!

<h3>Update 2022</h3>

I now replaced this website with a WordPress version at [https://morphicwebcomic.com/](https://morphicwebcomic.com/). You can still view the Gatsby version with the link indicated above. However, I won't post anything new on it from now on, so [follow this link to view the latest Morphic updates!](https://morphicwebcomic.com/)
