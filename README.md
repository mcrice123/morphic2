    Website for my graphic novel series

I am a web developer by day and a comic artist by night. 
My current home for my pet project ["Morphic"](https://mcrice123.github.io/morphic/) (repository [here](https://github.com/mcrice123/morphic))is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). 

I love generating my site without needing a database or server and I like how easy it is to work with Go. 
However, as a **front end developer** with experience using React, I want to show off my knowledge and skills using this popular JavaScript library.

[GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) is a static site generator using [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/). I am excited to create a new home for my comic with all the benefits of my current site and React!
