# It's been a long time coming...

But _at last_, **page 33 is _DONE!_**

In addition, I finished page 34 this morning, _so it's ready to be uploaded next week!_

**This calls for a victory dance!**

And here's a quick link to [page 32](https://mcrice123.github.io/morphic/blog/book2/book-2-page-32/) if you need a refresher on what the previous page looks like. 

### So what took me so long?

Good question. In January, I struggled to find motivation to draw pages 33 and 34. 
It's surprising, b/c **I took December off from doing anything for "Morphic" so that I would regain my energy.** 

Apparently, that wasn't enough. 

So from January through last week (roughly 4.5 months), I resorted to reworking and coloring Book 1 pages and making status update posts that feature each "new" uploaded page. 

**I also started drawing rough sketches of scenes to come in Book 2, so that I can figure out further how the plot should go.** 

After a long pause on Book 1 progress, I decided to give pages 33 and 34 another shot. 

**I like how they turned out!** 

I think I did a solid job on these pages.

### Like it? It's all digital!

Well, _almost_.

_This_ page was penciled the traditional way, like I did with all my other pages.
**However, I was feeling _really_ stalled while drawing page 34, so I decided to try something new!** 
I scanned what I had done in pencil and finished "penciling" page 34 on GIMP. 
**Then I inked _both_ pages on the same software and continued as normal with text bubbles and coloring.**

I also used a different lighting/shading style from the previous page, b/c I found one I like from coloring Book 1 pages. 

### Thanks for reading!

I really appreciate your patience over the past few months. 
I look forward to sharing the next page with you next week!

**Have a great weekend!**

 _Happy Memorial Day!_
