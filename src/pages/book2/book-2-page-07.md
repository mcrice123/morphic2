# NICE TAIL CHAN

So proud of his expression in panel 5.

### Almost done with the semester!
I'm itching to get done with
my schoolwork so that I can get back into drawing more
pages.

Also, in case you missed my unscheduled announcement earlier
this week, **you can now make comments on my posts through
Disqus!** As I understand it, you do have to create a free
account with Disqus in order to comment, **but it's FREE and
you can comment on any site that uses Disqus** and that includes
a lot of sites. I went with Disqus because it was already
built into the template I used for this site.

### Thanks for reading!

Come back next week for MORE COSTUME-CLAD PEOPLE!
