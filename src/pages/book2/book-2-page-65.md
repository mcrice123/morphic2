_So many smart phones around here..._

## Well, that's it for 2020!

...For new comic page updates, that is! 

### More polished Book 1 pages, comin' right up

I'll be uploading nine updated pages for Book 1 next week. I've been working on pages 33 through 41 this month and I'm looking forward to finally finishing them! **One nice change: Lane and Errie actually _look_ like they fell in a river.**

### Christmas post for 2020

I'm planning on getting the Christmas post up two weeks from now. It's the only post I'll make in the month of December, as I am taking the month off. **Come the first Saturday of January, I will be back with page 66 of _Morphic_, Book 2!**
