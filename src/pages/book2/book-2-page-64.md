    'A two-way street takes up the bottom half of the panel, lined on both sides with one-story buildings, trees, and parked vehicles. A few whispy white clouds float in the blue sky above and the viewer can see for many blocks down the street, thanks to the off-centered angle (from top slightly-right to bottom slightly-left) of the street relative to the panel.',
    "\n",
    'Zooming up the street ("FWOOSH") on the left-side lane and around a sign standing on a median in the foreground, a tall, red-glowing figure back-tracks the street a few paces on the right-side lane and slows to a stop in front of two other silhouetted figures, a tall one standing and glowing yellow and one kneeling on the ground and not glowing. The red-glowing figure, who has long hair and a long tail trailing behind her, casts aside a shorter figure also enveloped in a fading red glow. A fluffy tail attached to the bottom of the shorter silhouette',"'",'s jacket-vest swings to the left as he catches his balance, his back facing the viewer. The four figures stand near a sidewalk and a two-story building with a slight overhang. A truck is parked in front of the same sidewalk, but in the foreground. ',

    'Panel 2.',
    "\n",
    '"A POLYMORPH?!!" exclaims Lily, raising both of her black-veined arms to either side of her with bent elbows and wrists. She stands on the right side of the panel, still glowing red, while Chan stands to the left, both characters visible above the shins.',
    "\n",
    '"OW..." mutters the orange-haired boy, looking up at the tall woman next to him with a look of annoyance as he cradles his left wrist to his chest. Scribbled stars are visible close to his hands. The red glow around him fades.',

    'Panel 3.',
    "\n",
    'Wolf appears up close in the foreground with a determined look on his face. He is viewed from an angle to his left as he raises his left arm closer to the viewer, only visible from the waist up. The trailing yellow glow around him suggests that he is walking almost towards the viewer, but to the left. In the background and on the right side of the panel, the silhouette of Errie appears to stand and watch, casting a shadow on the street.',

    'Lily continues speaking from off-screen, saying with her usual accent, "You guardians let in THAT MONSTER--?"',

    'Panel 4.',
    "\n",
    '"If you want to leave here ALIVE..." says Wolf, cutting her off as he points up at her with his right hand. "Tell me what you know! I have NO TEAM-- and NO DOOR!!! We are STUCK here!" He adds quietly, "...With THAT THING."',
    "\n",
    'Wolf',"'",'s yellow glow flares up around his right hand, emitting a short rushing sound ("FSH!"). He stands on the right side of the panel, facing the left, but his shoulders and chest face the viewer as he stands with his left arm behind him. Lily stands on the left side of the panel with her arms lowered and her red glow dissipated, but she holds up her gloved hands and leans back in a defensive gesture as she peers down in astonishment at the man',"'",'s finger, only inches from her face. Both characters are visible above their hips.',

_Wolf means **business** now._

## More pages finished!

Last week, I finished the next batch of pages! I now have up to page 70 finished and ready to post. However, my scheduled month-long break is coming up and I will post only one more page before then. **Other than a "Morphic"-themed Christmas post, there will be no new posts in December.**

## Housekeeping in progress

I aim to get some more Book 1 pages cleaned up and finalized by the end of November! I'm looking forward to polishing the girls' conversation with Capri. 

## Thanks for reading!

I'll be back in two weeks with the LAST PAGE UPDATE before December! 

Have a great weekend.
