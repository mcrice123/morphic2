_Catius:_ MWEWRREOWRR

_Translator:_ "Pass the ketchup, please."

_Translator:_ Uh, wait...

# Hope you like this pouncing cat!

**As you can see from the previous post, Catius and his glow not only breaks out of the panel, but also _extends across_ the lower part of _page 33_!**

I really had fun with this page once I figured out what should happen on it. 
I had a general idea, but I wasn't sure on the specifics, really. 

**It's funny, even though I was stuck on this page, it took less time to make than page 33!** 

By 10 hours---no joke!

The reason for the difference, I think, is that not as many characters show up in this page.
**It's a lot easier to produce a single panel that's zoomed in on _one cat_ versus a single panel showing people _running around a corner from squid tentacles_ and _getting squirted with water_...**

### Break time!

Yes, _the time has come_ for my month-long break from "Morphic"! 

**That means I won't post _anything_ for the next 4 weeks!**

I feel bad that I'm leaving Book 2 at such a cliffhanger---AGAIN. 
But I'm looking forward to getting stuff done that I didn't have time to do while working on "Morphic". 

Like sewing, baking, other art stuff, etc. 

**And who knows, maybe after the break I'll be motivated to continue Book 2 right away...**

No promises, though. 
This year has been pretty rough on my schedule. 
If I'm still having trouble after this break, I'll have to rethink how I do things. 

But that's for me to think about later. 
And since I don't anticipate having a page ready for the next post, **I'll post a status update with some kind of art after the break.**

### Thanks for reading!

**Alright, I'll be back on Saturday, July 6th!**

Have a good month!
