    'Panel 2 completely surrounds this full-width panel, which hovers on the left side. Glowing blue lines extend from the top of the page (including the margin), to a falling yellow plastic mask, which overlaps the top border of Panel 1. The mane around its outer edge and the string attached to both sides extends upwards, indicating that the mask is falling through space while framed by the panel borders.

The last page of Book 2's plot. Oh boy... I should have something momentous to say, but all I can think of is:

![Close-up on the mysterious boy with the lion mask, staring out of the picture with a very creepy smile.](/embed/creepy-mask.jpg)
![Same image as previous.](/embed/creepy-mask.jpg)
![Ditto.](/embed/creepy-mask.jpg)
![Creepy lion mask kid #4.](/embed/creepy-mask.jpg)
![Yes, here's another one.](/embed/creepy-mask.jpg)
![Are you creeped out yet?](/embed/creepy-mask.jpg)
![Yes, I did just post a whole line of the same image of creepy lion mask kid.](/embed/creepy-mask.jpg)

![Ok, last one.](/embed/creepy-mask.jpg)
![And here's an image of Lily's scared face--widened eyes, gritted teeth.](/embed/lily_is_alarmed.jpg)

As you might have guessed, I am kind of a fan of creepy-lion-mask kid. He's good at being **mysterious** and **not giving away too much information** right off the bat...oops, I guess that was an _inside_ pun.

Anyways, I should probably be more like him...as far as the _plot_ is concerned, that is...so, 'shutting up now.

## Two more pages to go!

The story line for Book 2 may be finished, but there are two extra pages left (74 and 75)! 

By the way, I totally forgot to announce that **pages 71 through 75 (which includes this one) are completely drawn in Clip Studio Paint!** You can check out what the software offers [here](https://www.clipstudio.net/en/). It's an amazing software. 

As I understand it, there is a free version of it called **Debut**, but the paid versions are very reasonably priced and sometimes you can get a special offer, such as free **Pro** version for a year when you buy certain models of the latest Wacom tablets or sales on either **Pro** or **Ex** (this one's the complete version). I recently got the latter during a half-off sale. They only gave a few days notice before the sale (I think) and it didn't last longer than a week.

So if you're going to get Clip Studio Paint but need to be economical about it, I suggest that you get the free version and check up daily on any news from them on the platform or on their Facebook page, because I don't know how frequently they run those half-off sales...

**I have more than one favorite thing about Clip Studio.** The brushes are _excellent_. The public resources are _extensive_. And it makes panel-creation and speech bubbles a _breeze_. 

Oh yeah, and the time it took for me to create these five pages in Clip Studio is cut shorter. It took me on average **13 hours** to complete these pages, compared to my previous average of 16-20 hours. 

Oh yeah, and there are _3D models_...you can take a human figure, plop it into a page, and adjust it to use as a reference. **No joke!**

'Stopping now, before I think of something else.
