Now Errie and Chan think that Wolf needs to take some lessons on etiquette, because "throwing" them into doors isn't one of them. 

## It's May!

As promised, I have uploaded the newest wave of pages for Book 1! 
Check them out below!

* [Page 1][1]

* [Page 2][2]

* [Page 9][3]

* [Page 10][4]

* [Page 11][5]

* [Page 12][6]

### Goodbye Prologue

In addition to these new pages, **you'll notice that I removed pages 3 through 8.** 
I decided to remove them because I didn't want to redo them and I felt that the scene they depict isn't really helping the overall story. 
**However, I added them as miscellaneous pages with new titles so that people can still see them.** 
Here are where you can find them now (including the original pages for 1 and 2): 

* [Page 1 (Original Lineart)][7]

* [Page 2 (Previous Version)][8]

* [Page 3][9]

* [Page 4][10]

* [Page 5][11]

* [Page 6][12]

* [Page 7][13]

* [Page 8][14]

And now there's only 68 pages in Book 1, instead of 72!

### Thanks for reading!

Stay safe and stay healthy as best you can! 
I'll be back in two weeks with the next page...**which will be the last page I'll post before I go on break for the month of June.**

Have a great weekend!
