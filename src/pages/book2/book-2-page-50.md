Chan shares a valid point as to why people _shouldn't_ run from every morphic in sight...

## Update on March Goal

I finished the base colors of the next 4 pages! 
And they will all be shaded this coming week, so I should have page 51 posted on its scheduled day. 

After that, I will take a week off from drawing before working on some Book 1 pages. 
The one lesson I'm taking away from this month is that **I need to enforce short monthly breaks**.

I planned ahead for another break near the end of April/beginning of May, although it's not a week long. 
I'm hoping I can get done with the April goal early to have a longer break. 
**The April goal consists of only shading and finalizing 6 pages of Book 1**, which should be way less work than drawing 4 pages from scratch. 
I estimate that it should get done in two and a half weeks, but I'll have to aim for two weeks to get that break time in.

Oh well. We'll see if I can do it!

### Thanks for reading!

Hope you're all doing well and staying healthy. 
If you're looking for something to do and you have a lot of time on your hands, you _could_ I don't know...**reread the story from the beginning?**

_Heheh..._

Anyways, I'll be back in 2 weeks with the next page. 
(Just before Easter, wow! Time flies.) 

Have a great weekend!
