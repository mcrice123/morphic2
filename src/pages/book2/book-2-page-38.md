Looks like these Morphics have a lot to catch up on!

## Book 2 Progress update

I'm almost done with page 39, so that will be ready to post for the next update! 
I'm also hoping to be done with 40 through 42 at the end of next week. 
**Then I'll start drawing the last batch of pages before the holidays, pages 43 through 46.**

## Book 1 Progress update

All that's left now to finish Book 1 are one or both of two steps per page: lighting/shading and finalizing!

This month, I'm attempting to get lighting and shading done on 12 pages. 
**Next month I will work on this same batch, but I'll be finalizing them, along with about 10 other pages that are already shaded.** 
If I keep up the pace, I'll upload these 20-something pages around the beginning of November and I will consider them _finished!_

In the succeeding months (except December), I'll alternate between shading/lighting and finalizing until all the pages are finished (probably in May).

## Thanks for reading!

I'll be back in two weeks to post the next page! 
Have a great weekend.
