_Ouch._

Poor Wolf...verbal assault from teenagers is not fun.

## January Goal Achieved! 

I finished pages 47 through 50 _early_! 
That gives me four pages in the buffer for February and March. 
I rewarded myself with a day dedicated to doing something different than the usual routine and then started on my February goal a few days early. 

### Progress begins for February goal

I'm aiming to have **six finalized pages** for Book 1 by the end of February. 
**One of these pages will be a complete redrawing of _seven_ pages---the prologue scene with the settlers.**

### Goodbye Prologue

I've had _years_ to think over how the prologue scene could most benefit the story. 
I realized as I made more pages that **I still had this tidbit of history I was hoping to reference** somewhere in the plot, but I hadn't made use of it yet.
Whenever this thought comes to mind, I tell myself, **"That's ok, I'll think of a good place to reference that when the right scene comes along. I just can't do it yet without it sounding awkward."**

I was certain I needed the prologue when I colored it last year and I got more attached to it after redrawing the panel with Wolf pouncing on a guy. (I'm _proud_ of that panel!)

However, even after coloring those pages, I still felt a cringe---yes, a _cringe_---when I read that part with the rest of the story. 
**It was easy to excuse _cringing_ when the pages weren't even _redrawn_ or _colored_, but I put a lot of work into making those pages look nice...and it didn't seem right to ignore my cringes _now_.**

Therefore, for the past few months, I thought hard about what to do with the prologue. 
I had two options:

1) Figure out a plan for how to tie in references to the prologue in Book 3, if not Book 2. 

2) Condense the prologue pages down to only the necessary info, so that it people aren't confused when they read it, but still get the point. **And this info _could_ be displayed in as little as _one_ page.**

I went through some self-searching at this point. I don't take 'deleting' pages lightly, especially ones that have been around from the beginning. **I also didn't want to admit that this scene was redundant, b/c it wasn't redundant to _me_.**

I was _certain_ I could make it work with the plot. I _had_ to, b/c it's been around since...four years ago.

**...Wait, _four_ years ago?!**

That's a _long_ time. 
The story has changed so much since then...and I could see it _benefitting_ from this cut! 

_[sigh]_

That settles it. I have only this to say to the prologue scene:

**"Thank you, 'prologue scene'.**

**You used to spark joy when I first started this comic.**

**Now you don't, so it's time to let you go...to the miscellaneous section of the website, where readers can still see you and learn how you influenced the story.**

**The work I spent on you was never wasted.**

**Farewell."**

_...This move will happen at the end of February, by the way. I haven't got the new replacement page done yet!_

Also, thanks Marie Kondo, for the book "The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up". 
The lessons inside may pertain to "cleaning house", but it helped me get over some major setbacks while writing "Morphic". 
Here's a link to her [website](http://www.mariekondobooks.com/) if you're interested in checking it out!

## Thanks for reading!

And wow, this turned into a _huge_ post! But oh well, you can see how attached I can get to old pages. 

**I look forward to sharing the next page with you!** I am _so_ excited. 

See you in two weeks and have a great weekend!
