Weird stuff happens.

Also, I am starting a collection of embed images based on my characters' expressions. I got one for 'devious' and one that could work as 'suspicious' or 'confused'. :)

## Quick update: Clip Studio is awesome!

I got everything done except shading and lighting on my current batch of new pages! It's going along so quickly, that I am considering adding in a **fifth** page to this batch.

I may share my observed comparison of Clip Studio, Photoshop, and GIMP in a later post. All you need to know now is that I'm excited to finally get a page done in **less than 16 clocked hours!!!** And these recent pages I did in GIMP started going over twenty...
