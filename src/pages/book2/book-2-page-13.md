# HUH...

Nothing like a see-through, walk-through tiger in the
kitchen to make one question her own senses.

### Quick Status!

Book 2 page buffer is still growing. Yay!

I decided to redraw and color one of the Book 1 pages
and now that it's done, it's uploaded! Check out
[page 5][1]!

### Thanks for reading!

Come back next week to see the next page of book 2! And who
knows, there _could_ be another colored/updated page of
book 1..._maybe_. No promises, but just saying. It could
happen.
