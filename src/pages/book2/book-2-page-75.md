## Yay, two books down, one to go!

Even though I still need to clean up these pages, I may as well congratulate myself on sticking with my posting schedule for this long! I have **over 140 pages** available to read on this website.

### Monthly posts begin

I'll reiterate my announcement from my last post:

**I am taking a year-long break from creating new content for _Morphic_.** I have a few goals for how I will use this time:
* Clean up the pages in Books 1 and 2, with the mindset of getting them print-ready. 
* Think some more on the plot for Book 3. 
* Allow myself time to work on other artwork, both _Morphic_-related and not. 

During my break, I'll check in each month and share a little bit of what I'm doing, preferably about content that promotes _Morphic_. I have my calendar marked for Saturday, June 5th, as the date for my first monthly post. I look forward to seeing you then!

### Notice anything new?

I made a few updates on the website this week, including the addition of a **short announcement section** at the top of all the pages. My main motivation for adding that section is to **provide returning readers a quick link back to this post** so that they can read my explanation about the delay in starting Book 3.

I also added some nice hover effects to some of the buttons and updated the font family used for body text in all my posts. "Open Sans" was ok, but I found that "Source Sans Pro" is a lot easier to read.

Anyway, I tackled some other updates that I had been meaning to do for a while. What started as a quick task of adding that announcement section...turned into a three-hour marathon of website touch-ups and fixes. _But it was worth it._

## Thanks for reading!
