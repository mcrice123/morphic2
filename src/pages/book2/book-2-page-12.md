# Yeah Mom, get off the phone

Smartphones are so distracting, you know? It keeps
people from noticing things going on around them,
including the important stuff...such as when there's
a tiger in the kitchen.

### Status Update

I'm making good progress on growing my page buffer.
So far I'm finished with pages up to page 16, which
covers about a month of weekly updates (yay!).
I'm also starting to chip away at the rework of some of
the pages for Book 1.

That said, I calculated the amount of work it will take me
to color/touch up Book 1. I divided the work into 3 steps:

* **Rework** (fix line art, text bubbles/boxes, redrawing)
* **Flatting** (covering areas with color for easy selection)
* **Coloring** (final colors, shading, brights, final touch-ups)

Out of Book 1's 74 pages, currently:

* **30** need Rework
* **~50** need Flatting
* **All but one page** need Coloring

The only page that doesn't need _anything_ done on it is
page 73, the excerpt from the 'Ancient Creatures' book. I
decided it didn't need coloring and it's fine the way it is.

**So...1 down, 73 to go!**

### Thanks for reading!

Come back next week to find out what happens on the next
page update! Have a great weekend.
