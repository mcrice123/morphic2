The sheriff makes another appearance.

He's probably curious about
some word changes I just made on some pages. I replaced
'heatstroke' with 'dehydration' on pages 14 and 16 of Book 2.
See, I didn't read up on what heatstroke was until I
uploaded the page. Let's just say it implies more of a life-
and-death situation than I'd like (think 'coma'---I slap myself
for not looking harder at the 'stroke' side of 'heatstroke').
Since I was looking for
a quick medical diagnosis that implies delirium rather than
unconsciousness, 'dehydration' seems like a better medical
explanation for Chan's behavior.

And there's your life lesson for the day. **Look up the
illness before using it in your story.**

Anyways...
