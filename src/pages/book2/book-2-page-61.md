_Nothing amps up an action sequence quite like having an explosion randomly appear in the distance._

## Welcome to my new website!

I am excited to finally share this site with the public! It's great to have a fresh new look for displaying my webcomic. That, combined with the new lettering that's underway, makes me feel like I'm making a high-quality comic and therefore approaching the end...

## Goals going forward

I recently mapped out all the items I need to finish for me to complete the webcomic and proceed with the crowdfund campaign for printing it as a graphic novel. 

Here are the items, with expected year of completion:

* Update text (100+ pages, 2022)

* Book 1 rework (30+ pages, 2021)

* Book 2 finish new pages (8+ pages, 2021)

* Book 2 rework (30+ pages, 2022)

* Book 3 start and completion (70+ pages, 2023)

Yes, **I am predicting that it will take me three years to complete _Morphic_.** I calculated these time ranges based on the assumption that I will be working a full time job until all the pages are complete. **And because I never ran a crowdfund campaign before, I think this lengthy amount of time will help me gain a large audience and help my chances of funding my campaign successfully.** 

## I will keep the old website up

I don't anticipate any need to take the old site down, since the hosting and domain name are free. However, I won't make any posts or updates there anymore. I'll probably just reference it if I ever want to remind people how the webcomic used to look in the year 2020. 

## Thanks for reading!

**If you haven’t already, please like the [“Morphic” Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/MorphicGraphicNovel/) and [subscribe to my mailing list](http://eepurl.com/g8TzPb)** to get news and updates on progress towards the crowdfund campaign for printing _Morphic_!
I appreciate all the support. 

I'll be back in two weeks with the next page. Have a good weekend!
