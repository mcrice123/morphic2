_I guess this means the Q & A session is over..._

So much stuff happening on this page! **Including a proper intro for that [tiger girl][1]!**

## Welcome Back! And Happy 4th of July!

During my very restful break, I got to do some casual sketching and writing...and welcome home my very own kitten! 
**MEOW.**

**This week I added a bunch of updates and fixes to the website!**

### Website Updates

There was apparently a routing bug in the archive section, but that's fixed now and I renamed the section 'Chapters'. 
I also took out the 'Cast' section with the intention of rebuilding it so that it looks nicer. 

I updated the About page with up-to-date info **and my new logo!** 
_(Pictured to the right)_

I also added a **new logo link for "Morphic"** in the navigation menu! 

I took out the Disqus comments, since no one seems to be using it. 
_I don't mind **not** having it, but I can easily add it back in if I see that readers want to use it._

Furthermore, **I now have a mailing list set up for subscribers.** 
If you want to get news and updates about new crowdfunding campaigns for "Morphic", **[please click here to subscribe!](http://eepurl.com/g8TzPb)**

I don't have any hard plans to start a campaign yet, but when I do, I will send information about it to subscriber emails first!

### Final thoughts

I think in a recent post I mentioned that I wanted to make a new website for "Morphic". 
However, **I ultimately decided against it.** 
I realized by the end of my month-long break that my motivation to keep building the new site was _very_ low. 
I mulled over the reasons I had for wanting the new website in the first place---**this site was buggy and I wanted to make the site from scratch, all by myself.**

But the new site would also have disadvantages---after **2 weeks of intensive coding**, I will still have to deal with **new bugs** and add **new features that the current site _already_ has**.
The thought have having a struggling site to deal with throughout the year was enough to zap my interest in finishing it. 

So I came to a compromise...

* I keep the current site and fix all the little routing bugs. 
* I add a few things to "freshen up" (like adding that logo in the navigation and my new artist logo on the About page).
* In time, I can change the color scheme if I want, but keep the structure as is.

I like the idea of having a website I made myself, without a template, but take this from a web developer with four years of work experience---**making a brand-new website from scratch is a lot of work!**
I finally accepted that starting a website from a template is probably my best bet for any of my art-related websites going forward. 
**I want to be able to focus more on my art than my website anyway.**
