_Bye Morphics! It was nice knowing 'ya!_

## Book 2 Progress 

Good news! 
I finished the last 2 new pages for the year! 

That leaves 4 pages in the buffer currently --- I'm going to post page 43 in 2 weeks and hold the rest until after my December break is over. 
**Therefore, the next page update will be the last new page of the year!**

## Book 1 Progress 

After finishing those Book 2 pages, I continued lighting and shading more Book 1 pages. 
**I finished shading/lighting 3 pages this week and I aim to do 3 more within another week.**

You'll be able to see these pages after I finish them at the end of this month. 
**Out of the 17 pages I'm aiming to properly finish, 12 were previously not colored.**
I can't wait to share them with you! 
I really like how they're turning out. 

## Thanks for reading! 

In the next post, I'll talk more about the upcoming break.

Have a great weekend and see you in two weeks!
