**Tenti is super absorbent.**

## Book 2 Status

I got done with page 39, as you can see. 
**I also finished page 40.** 
I haven't finished pages 41 and 42 yet, but I'm going to...work it in. 
I'll explain in the next paragraph. 

## I ignored Book 1 rework this week

I ran into a bit of artist's block this week, so I chose to cut back the workload to only pages 39 and 40 of Book 2. 
I am now officially behind on Book 1 shading and lighting, so I'm extending my first deadline of uploading finalized pages to the **end of November**, instead of end of October/early November. 

**I want to put my _very best_ into these pages, so I think the extra time will ease the stress to get it done in time.**

### Thanks for reading! 

I'll be back in two weeks with page 40 and I'm already looking forward to showing it to you! **You won't want to miss it!** 

Have a great weekend! See you in 2 weeks!
