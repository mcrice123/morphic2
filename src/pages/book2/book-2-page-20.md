WELL UH OH

Things are about to get interesting...again.

# Taking it easy

I decided to take a break from drawing last week, so
now as of today, my buffer consists of only two pages.
OH WELL.

Good news is, I'm in the middle of coloring 2 more pages,
so I anticipate having a 3-page buffer after next week's
update.

### Another colored page in Book 1

Check out [page 27](https://mcrice123.github.io/morphic/blog/book-1-page-27/)
! It's fun to see how the glowing vines turn out. **And
nothing makes my day like painting grass. LOOK AT THE
BEAUTIFUL GRASS!**

### Thanks for reading!

Come back next week to find out **WHAT THE HEY** is going on
in Lane's house!

Have a great weekend!
