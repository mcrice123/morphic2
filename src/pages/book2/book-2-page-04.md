And now back to our protagonist!

I'm going to miss drawing these landscapes. They were **super** easy and very pretty!

# Short Update

I didn't stick with the daily posts of fox videos this week. I got really busy and I
kept forgetting.

However, based on previous experience, I never really got much reaction on those
video posts. Therefore, I think I should just stick to posting a few videos every now
and then, instead of a whole week of daily posts. I like sharing fun videos, but posting
them is tiring.

In other news, the 'end-of-the-semester' stress fest is upon me. I'm coloring
a few pages that I'm planning on uploading before the semester is up. I still think I
can get them done on time because I have a two-week buffer right now. They should be done
by then.

# Thanks for reading!
Come back next week to find out what Errie's up to!
