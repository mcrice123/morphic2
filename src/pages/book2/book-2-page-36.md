## Vix to the Rescue!

...Maybe?

'Guess we'll see what's happening in the next page update. 

### Quick update

**For Book 2**, the next 2 pages are finished and ready to post in the upcoming weeks!
I also started a new batch of pages this week (pages 39 through 42).

**For Book 1**, I'm currently working away at covering each uncolored page in base colors. 
The remaining number is down to roughly 20 pages (out of about 30-ish).

### Still experimenting

Have you noticed that the glows on this page look different? 
So do those on the previous page. 
**I realized that I didn't like the previous glow style that much, so I tried some other layer modes.** 
I feel a lot better about making the glows show up in "Addition" mode rather than "Multiply" mode (what it was before). 
It appears to make more sense---it lightens everything...like it's actually _glowing_. 

I have a hard time deciding b/w layer modes sometimes, b/c the result of each can look different from what I expect. 
It's why I kept all layers on "Normal" mode for so long. 

## Thanks for reading!

I'll post the next page in 2 weeks, as usual.

Have a great weekend!
