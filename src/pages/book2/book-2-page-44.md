Sounds like the "police" will be here any minute now. _Hehehee..._

## December Break is over!

Welcome back! 
I hope you had a merry Christmas and a good start to the new year. 

I, for one, had a very restful month off and got to spend time with family, which is great. 
**Now I'm ready to dive back into the drawing comic pages!**

### Next Six Months

**First, I'm going to continue posting one page every 2 weeks.**
Now that page 44 is up, I only have pages 45 and 46 left in my buffer. 
**This month, I'll draw the following four pages**, which will fulfill the scheduled posts in February and March. 
This future buffer will allow me to **rework some Book 1 pages in February** and **draw another batch of four new pages** (Book 2) during March.
This second batch of new pages will cover the scheduled posts in April and May so that I can repeat the same cycle in that timeframe. 

After drawing four new pages in May, **I will take a break from drawing for the month of June**, so _those_ new pages will provide a buffer in August/September when I return and start drawing again.

### Goals for 2020

Based on my rate of production for the previous 6 months, I predict I can accomplish the following goals:

1) **20 new pages** for Book 2 (4 pages/month for 5 months)

2) **38 reworked pages** for Book 1 (about 8 pages/month for 5 months)

Simple math shows that I won't get either Book 1 rework or Book 2 finished this year. 

> **Book 2** - End of 2020

> 20 page goal + 46 current pages = **66** total (some in buffer)

> I'm guessing I'll need **74** pages total (using Book 1's old total for prediction)

> **Book 1** - End of 2020

> 38 page goal + 17 finished pages = **55** finished pages 

> Total number of pages: ~~74~~ **68** (I decided to combine a few pages)

While it _is_ possible that Book 2 could end up shorter than Book 1, _I highly doubt it will._ 
I predict that Book 2 will end up longer than Book 1, so I see no hope in finishing Book 2 this year. 
**I might get close, though.** 

And Book 1 rework will overflow into 2021, but oh well. **I'll get a huge chunk of lineart pages colored this year!**

### Thanks for reading!

I'll be back in 2 weeks with the next page. Have a great weekend!
