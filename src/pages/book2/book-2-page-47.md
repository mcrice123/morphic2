WHAT. 

IS THAT.

Time to run..._again._

## New character---YAY!

I had fun drawing this gal. 
Too bad it's kind of hard to tell what kind of Morphic she is. 
It will make sense when you know it though.
I have a name in mind for her, but I'm hesitating to announce it until I'm sure about it. 

So for now, I guess I'll call her "the new girl".

### Book 1 Progress

I am about half way through shading and lighting **5 out of the 6 pages** I was hoping to have done by the end of this month. 
**The sixth page (page 2) is completely redrawn and ready for me to start shading and lighting.** 

However, for a reason I did not foresee, I have to put off posting page 2 until the end of April.

**The reason _why..._** it doesn't flow right with the next page. I had an idea in mind on how to combine pages 2 through 8 into one page, but **I didn't look at page 9 before drawing it.** 
(Intuitively, page 9 will become the 3rd page, but I'll still keep the original page numbers to avoid too much confusion.)

As a result, **the "prologue pages" get to stay up for another 2 months** before I replace them. 
I'll proceed with shading and lighting page 2 this month, but I'll finalize it with the other pages from the same scene that I'll be working on in April. 
**No big deal.**

And because the next post will occur on the last weekend of the month, **I will post the finished 5 pages of Book 1** along with the new Book 2 page, 2 weeks from today. I'll be updating pages 25 through 29. 

## Thanks for reading!

Come back in 2 weeks to see what happens next! Have a great weekend! 

(Also, happy Valentine's day...)
