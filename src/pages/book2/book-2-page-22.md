**DUN DUN DUN**

_Aaaaaaand_ scene. I'm letting the suspense sit for a while.
**In the meantime, we're going check out what the other
characters are up to...**

# Yet _another_ busy week!

You guessed it, no new colored pages in Book 1 this week. I
am even busier than last week, it seems. Lots of new stuff
coming up and limited access to wifi didn't help. Thankfully,
this page buffer helps me to not worry about new pages for
Book 2, since I still have new pages ready for the next
two weeks.

However, I still have high hopes of having another colored
Book 1 page ready for  next week, since the one I'm working
on is actually almost finished. I just couldn't touch it
this week.

But that's all the more reason to check out next week's post!

### Thanks for reading!

 Get excited, because **this upcoming scene will have _more_
 new characters!** _I can't wait..!_

Have a great weekend!
