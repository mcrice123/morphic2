And the police station _finally_ picks up---!

**Oh.**

Hi there...

## Last Page of 2019 

Two weeks from now I'll start my month-long break from making comic pages, therefore this is the last page update for Book 2 until I return. 
**However, next week I'll upload the Book 1 pages I've been finishing. I'll also post a small Christmas doodle.** 

Out of the 17 pages I'm hoping to finish by December, I have 12 finished, **so five more are left!**
I'm confident I'll have them done in time. 

### Looking back

This year has been a weird one. 
I hear that the year following college graduation is usually rough and for me it was _definitely_ big adjustment. 
Looking back, though, I'm glad I was able to keep the comic going, even at the slow pace of one page every 2 weeks. 

As for looking ahead, I desire to keep up the consistent page updates for Book 2 and behind-the-scenes progress for Book 1. I'll talk more on that later. 

## Thanks for reading!

I'll be back **next week** with some _shiny, newly-colored_ pages for Book 1! And a Christmas doodle. 

Have a great weekend!
