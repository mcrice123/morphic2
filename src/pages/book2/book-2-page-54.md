_Errie seizes the opportunity to ask some **burning questions**._

## Next post scheduled for Sat, July 4th!

**Thanks for following the story** for the last five months! 
**I'm going to wrap up the next 4 pages _this week_** and then take a **4-week break** so that I can keep drawing without burnout for another five months. 

### A few thoughts on Book 1 printing

My goal has always been to run a crowdfund campaign to have Book 1 printed as soon as it's completely colored. 
It's still a goal, but there are a few disadvantages that will make that goal a real challenge. 

1. I never ran a crowdfund campaign before. 
2. I'm phone shy. 
3. I might have to do some potentially time-consuming file conversions on my image files to prepare for printing. 
I'm not looking forward to battling that out. 

I still think it's worth it to _try_ crowdfunding it someday, but I think what I'll do first is **make Book 1 available as a downloadable pdf** that people can print themselves. 
**This seems like the simplest approach** and I could potentially keep track of how many times it gets downloaded, giving me an idea of how many people are interested enough to have their own copy of it. 

### So when will I finish Book 1? 

At the rate I'm going, I expect I could finish coloring Book 1 by the end of _next year_. 

...Yeah. That's a _while._

I still have **40** pages to revamp before I can call Book 1 done. 
**28** pages are completely finished out of **68** total pages (less than half done). 

It would be nice if I could get these pages done faster, but this is as fast as I can go without burning out. 
And I'm learning as I go along that **breaks are important!**

Anyways, **this _will_ take a while, but I'm sticking with it!** 
I look forward to having a printable pdf of these _finished pages_ by the end of 2021!
