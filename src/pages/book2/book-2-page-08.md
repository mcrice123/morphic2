Definitely proud of this page---especially the last panel.

# All done!

School is officially over for me and I got to draw a bunch this week.
I just got page 9 done, so next week's page is ready to upload. I'm
also nearly done with page 10.

However, even though summer is here, I don't have as much time
on my hands because I've committed to working more. (It helps that I do
not have classes, har har.) Therefore, I don't expect to produce more
than 2 pages a week.

I **do** expect to keep up the weekly page updates and as usual, I'll post
the number of pages ready to go with each page update.

### Thanks for reading!

Come check out next week's page to find out what Errie does when she's
grounded. (Yes, she's grounded, if that wasn't clear.)
