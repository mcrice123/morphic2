## Huh, where did Errie's mom go?

Hmmmmmm...

Maybe we'll find out on the _next_ page...? 
We'll see in 2 weeks, I guess.

### Book 2 progress

Good news! 
Since the last post, I finished **4 new pages!**
So in addition to the page in this post, I have _3 pages_ in the buffer. 
**That covers the next two posts before I go on break in December!**

I still have two more pages shade and light before the end of this month and I expect to get those done this coming week. 
**Then I'll have 3 pages in buffer come January.** 
So I can start posting pages right away while I'm starting another round of pages!

### Book 1 

I'll take a short break between finishing Book 2 pages in October and finalizing Book 1 pages in November. 
I created a schedule of tasks in November already and it looks like I could reach my goal...

**I have 17 pages picked out that I want to properly finish and upload in the course of one month.** 
You may remember that I wrote about my behind-the-scenes work in previous months on all Book 1 pages that aren't yet colored. 
**All Book 1 pages are now in the shading/lighting stage, which for me is the _hardest_ stage.** 

But I'm much more optimistic about meeting this challenge than I was two weeks ago. 
I didn't even have _this_ page done when I wrote the previous post-- **I had _6_ pages waiting to be shaded!**
But I tried a new strategy that helped me finish _four!_

**If I can keep up the hard work for Book 1, I'll upload 17 _finished_ Book 1 pages at the end of November!**

### Thanks for reading! 

I'll be back in two weeks with the next page and more news about behind-the-scenes progress. 

Have a great weekend!
