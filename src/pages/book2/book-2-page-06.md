# Where have we seen this guy before...?

Oh yeah---it's *Chan*! The kid who skipped out on going to the
festival with his friends and thereby ended up missing out on an
exciting (and slightly terrifying) adventure in the woods.

YEP. That's him!

Don't worry, you'll be seeing a lot more of him
in this book... *[cackles quietly and ominously]*

### In other news

The next two pages actually took the most time to produce out of all
my colored pages so far! Despite that, I'm especially looking
forward to posting them because I think they came out really well!

So come check them out next week and the week after when they're
uploaded! Thanks for reading and have a great week!
