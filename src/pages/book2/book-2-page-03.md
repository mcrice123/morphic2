# Guess what I forgot last week

Remember that last week we saw Vix transform?
Remember what I usually do when we see a Morphic transform for the first time in the story?
**That's right---It's video-sharing time!** Featuring _foxes_!

I'll be posting more fox videos on my Facebook page throughout the week!
Also don't forget to check out the next page update next week!

Have a great weekend!
