The familiar figure of the white-haired girl enveloped in a magenta glow leaps off of his pain-stricken face ("FWOOSH"), proceeding towards the left side of the panel without any sign of remorse. Meanwhile, a small round object bounces across the pavement away from Wolf and his sword falls to the pavement near his feet.',

    '"Errie, what are you DOING?!" shouts Chan, stepping forward suddenly towards the right side of the panel. He stands near the left panel border, holding his hand out as Errie rushes determinedly across the panel, and leaps over the disappearing magenta glow, barely visible against the sunlit pavement. It emits a soft "FWSH".',

    '"HEY!" the orange-haired teenager shouts after her.',

_Oh, HI KIRI!_

_Uh...ok, bye Kiri._

## Quick update

Everything's going well here! I'm using Clip Studio to make a short comic for fun. I don't plan on showing it off when it's finished, because I think I could pitch it to publishers one day as an idea for a future graphic novel. 

Yeah, "Morphic" will remain _the_ public-facing sample of my work for the time-being. While I finish it up in the next three or four years, I will be preparing myself for whatever project comes next...and I'm opening up to the idea of pitching to publishers.

## Thanks for reading!
