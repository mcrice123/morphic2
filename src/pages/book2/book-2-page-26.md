Catius is really proud of his skillz.

## Check out this week's extra post!

[Part 3](https://mcrice123.github.io/morphic/blog/how-i-draw-part-3/) of "How I Draw" is up!

2 years ago, I only got to this stage in page production.
Believe me, it's a relief to finally get to color these
pages. I'll talk more about my progress on coloring pages
next week, but I hope you're enjoying this glimpse into my
drawing process.

I've been drawing this comic for two years between
college semesters, summer classes, and a part-time job. Now
I'm graduated, I have a full time job, and now I'm **coloring**
these pages! So much has changed and I'm looking forward to
revealing more of the story. One page at a time.

...I'm also looking forward to seeing Book 1 in full color,
but yeah. _One page at a time...per week..._

### Anyway

Thanks for reading! Don't forget to check out the extra post!

Have a great weekend!
