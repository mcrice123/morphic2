Doodling Capri is the best.

# Early Update

I'm going out of town this week, so I'm posting this page
today. I finished page 10 as expected, so I have no worries
about posting it on time next week. **Yay for meeting
deadlines!**

Anyways, now we get more of an explanation about the jar
referenced in the last page of Book 1.

### Thanks for reading!

Next week's page will have a change in pace, so remember to
come back and check out what happens!
