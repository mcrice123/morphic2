## That's a lot of sand...

This page sure was fun to draw! It sure is calming to draw an easy nature scene, especially on software that makes it easy to experiment. _(Shout-out to **Clip Studio Paint**.)_

Enjoy the pretty scene...I hope you like to read. :)

### BIG Announcement

Alright, one month is up and I've made up my mind.

**I need a longer break.**

**Reason #1**, I need to sit and think some more about the plot for Book 3. I don't think it's ready yet.

**Reason #2**, a good number of unfinished pages in Books 1 and 2 are _really_ getting to me and it seems like getting _all_ of them finished **before** starting Book 3 makes the most sense.

**Reason #3**...I think it's time for me to build up a professional portfolio.

Sure, "Morphic" is kind of my portfolio for now, but...some of those old pages...the thought of showing them to a publisher...

![Lily's scared face--widened eyes, gritted teeth](/embed/lily_is_alarmed.jpg) STRESS.

It's time for me to fix those pages. ONCE AND FOR ALL!

...And of course, I look forward to working on art that's _not_ necessarily related to this webcomic.

### So how long is this break?

[Awkward silence] ...

Until next May.

![Errie's alarmed face--widened eyes, mouth gaping open](/embed/errie_is_alarmed.jpg)

Yes, May 2022. That's a _whole year_ from now!

I chose this time range because that should be enough time for me to finalize all the pages up to this point...**142 pages in one year seems reasonable**, given that I can only work on the comic 10-20 hours per week. 

### What about the website updates?

I want to keep posting status updates and share what I'm doing, so I plan to post once a month. As usual, I will share the posts on the "Morphic" Facebook page. 

For now, **there is still one page left of Book 2!** I will post it in two weeks. In the meantime...

## Thanks for reading!

I appreciate all the support. 

I'll be back in two weeks with the LAST PAGE. Have a great weekend!
