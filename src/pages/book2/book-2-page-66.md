## Happy New Year!

I am looking forward to accomplishing a number of things this year:

* Finish finalizing Book 1

* Finish new pages for Book 2 (_almost_ there!)

* Finalize a bunch of pages in Book 2

* And **start Book 3!!!**

I started the last batch of pages for Book 2 yesterday. I mentioned before that I would use Clip Studio when I started Book 3 but keep using GIMP and my traditional methods for the rest of Book 2. However, I threw in the towel and decided to use it for these last few pages after all. **So pages 71 through 74 will be completely digital.** 

That's all for now.

## Thanks for reading!
