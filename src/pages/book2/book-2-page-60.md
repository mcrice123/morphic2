_Huh. Lily goes through walls._

## News about the current website

Weeks ago, I looked into giving this site a custom domain name so that the url is easier to market. 
**It turns out that the free hosting this site is on _probably won't_ let me remove '/morphic' from the end of it.**
So (using an example domain name) it may look like "example.com/morphic", even though I want "example.com". 

In addition to that little complication, I came up against a nasty little bug with the links in the chapters section. 
**It appears that clicking on the links to some updated pages in Book 1 shows the older version of the comic page, instead of the updated version.** 

I expect there to be a fix for this, but **I've spent many hours trying to fix the bug without success**.
I've searched the Hugo documentation and discussions on various forums for any leads.
I even checked the repo for the original third-party template, but it hasn't been updated by its owner for years.
And thus, the bug persists. 

But rather than be discouraged by these obstacles, I made a bold decision...

## I'm making a new website!

For the past few weeks, I continued working on the new website I had already started months ago and I'm close to finishing it! 
I predict that I'll have it ready to share by the next page update.
**On the next post, I will share a link to the new site and continue the webcomic from there!** 

One of the benefits of the new site is that I designed and built it _myself_... 
**No templates! It's all from scratch.** 
I decided to use another static site generator called [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and it's really cool and flexible to use compared to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). 

Like Hugo, I don't really recommend Gatsby for non-developers.
But it's great that I can build and customize my own website for free!

**Now in case there's a _specific question_ burning in your mind right now, here's a long rant (below) in reply to that _specific question_.** 
Feel free to skip it if you like.

And that _specific question_ is...

### Why not Wordpress? 

1. It is a minimum of $8 **per month** to have a customized site...that's about _$96 annually_.

2. I could get a free template for no extra charge, **but I am assuming I can't change any piece of it** and that if any bugs are present, I'll either have to find a better template or live with it. 
**I also don't think there are a lot of Wordpress templates for webcomics**, since they're not as popular as they used to be. 
And those that exist are probably years old and if they were't updated recently, they probably have bugs...

3. I heard hearsay years ago that I could buy a custom domain name from a cheaper provider and still use it for my Wordpress site. However, I don't see any confirmation of this from my research. **I would still get charged a minimum of $4..._per month_...to have a custom domain name _at all_** on my site, whether I get the domain name through Wordpress or not!
_(That's $48 annually... compare this cost to [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/registration/gtld/com/), which offers '.com' domains for $9-$13/year!)_

**The conclusion: I would have to pay extra for a custom site _and_ a custom domain if I go with Wordpress.**

I understand that Wordpress is probably a great platform. 
I've heard good things about it and I believe it earned its good reputation. 
**But I won't generate any immediate profit from this website and as long as there are free/low-cost hosting options and custom domains available, I can't justify using this popular platform for _Morphic_.** 

_[exhales]_

I hope you find this discussion interesting.
It bothers me that Wordpress is the most well-known platform and yet the prices of its paid plans are so steep.

In fact, one of the perks of having a static site instead of a CMS is that _there are FREE hosting options available!_ 
**YEAH!**

Take _that_, Wordpress.

## Thanks for reading!

Come back in two weeks to see the next page... **on the new website!** 
I'll probably do a fun doodle to go with the next post...which will be the _last_ post on _this_ site, if everything goes well with the _new_ website. **I can't wait to show it off!**

**If you haven’t already, please like the [“Morphic” Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/MorphicGraphicNovel/) and [subscribe to my mailing list](http://eepurl.com/g8TzPb)** to get news and updates on progress towards the crowdfund campaign for printing _Morphic_!
I appreciate all the support.
