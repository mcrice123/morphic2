_Huh. Lily goes through walls._

## News about the current website

Weeks ago, I looked into giving this site a custom domain name so that the url is easier to market. 
**It turns out that the free hosting this site is on _probably won't_ let me remove '/morphic' from the end of it.**
So (using an example domain name) it may look like "example.com/morphic", even though I want "example.com". 

In addition to that little complication, I came up against a nasty little bug with the links in the chapters section. 
**It appears that clicking on the links to some updated pages in Book 1 shows the older version of the comic page, instead of the updated version.** 

I expect there to be a fix for this, but **I've spent many hours trying to fix the bug without success**.
I've searched the Hugo documentation and discussions on various forums for any leads.
I even checked the repo for the original third-party template, but it hasn't been updated by its owner for years.
And thus, the bug persists. 

But rather than be discouraged by these obstacles, I made a bold decision...

## I'm making a new website!

For the past few weeks, I continued working on the new website I had already started months ago and I'm close to finishing it! 
I predict that I'll have it ready to share by the next page update.
**On the next post, I will share a link to the new site and continue the webcomic from there!** 

One of the benefits of the new site is that I designed and built it _myself_... 
**No templates! It's all from scratch.** 
I decided to use another static site generator called [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and it's really cool and flexible to use compared to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). 

Like Hugo, I don't really recommend Gatsby for non-developers.
But it's great that I can build and customize my own website for free!

## Why not Wordpress?

Well folks, it looks like I made up my mind too early regarding this CMS. I only looked up Wordpress via [Wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com/) when I did a Google search for it and that's where I found these paid plans that I previously mentioned in this post. It basically _looked_ like I would have to pay a bunch of money for a customizable website and control over how the domain name looks. 

**However, I recently found out that you can customize your own Wordpress site _for free_ by downloading the _opensource_ version** at [Wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/). I was able to download the default project and see all the files. I haven't tried hosting anything yet, but this alone shows the platform in a new light for me. 

And to think that I missed it b/c I went to the wrong domain... 

However, I am not unhappy with my decision to use GatsbyJS. One of the perks of having a static site instead of a CMS is that _there are FREE hosting options available._ I don't know how much it would cost to host the opensource version of Wordpress (it probably depends on the size of the database), but I don't expect it to be free.

Thanks for bearing with me as I learn new things!

Come back in two weeks to see the next page... **on the new website!** 
I'll probably do a fun doodle to go with the next post...which will be the _last_ post on _this_ site, if everything goes well with the _new_ website. **I can't wait to show it off!**
