Ouch. That's gotta hurt.

## Ooo, new character! 

...with a creepy-looking mask. 

_oooOOOOOooooo_

I had a lot of fun drawing this kid. I look forward to drawing him more!

### Five more pages finalized! (Book 1)

Three of them were colored last year, but I redid the cell-shading to match the newly-colored pages. 
Here are the five pages I updated: 

* [Page 25](https://mcrice123.github.io/morphic/blog/book-1-page-25/)
* [Page 26](https://mcrice123.github.io/morphic/blog/book-1-page-26/)
* [Page 27](https://mcrice123.github.io/morphic/blog/book-1-page-27/)
* [Page 28](https://mcrice123.github.io/morphic/blog/book-1-page-28/)
* [Page 29](https://mcrice123.github.io/morphic/blog/book-1-page-29/)

In addition, I added some extra lettering to [page 31](https://mcrice123.github.io/morphic/blog/book-1-page-31/) so that there are consistent sound effects across all these pages. 

With that, **February goal achieved!** Now onto March...

### Goal for March

I'm switching back to producing four Book 2 pages, before the buffer runs out. 
I have enough to cover the month of March, so yay! 

I am a little concerned about my motivation level. 
I had a lot of trouble staying motivated with working on Book 1 pages this month, but I'm hoping that it was because I needed a break after spending so much energy on new Book 2 pages the previous month. 

So that's something for me to keep an eye on this month. 

## Thanks for reading!

Come back in two weeks to see the next page! Have a great weekend!
