_Oh, I guess Errie is ok now..._

Also, this page fulfills the long-lived desire of mine to tie up some loose ends.
If you don't know what I mean, maybe try re-reading Book 2. :D

## More Social Media

I've been thinking a lot lately about next steps for _Morphic_ and I came to the conclusion that it's time I actually promote the webcomic more actively on social media. 
**I'm waiting to add a link to Twitter, but here's a link to [my Instagram profile!](https://www.instagram.com/mariacatrice222/)**
I've had the account for probably a year now, but I made my first post today. 

_Sigh..._ I hope to get better at this social media thing. It's my best bet for expanding my audience right now. 

### Speaking of expanding my audience...Please share!

The more people who know about my comic, the more people who will know to listen for my future crowdfund campaign for _Morphic_...
And the more people who know about the future crowdfund campaign for _Morphic_, the more people who will actually pledge money on the campaign, therefore **increasing the chances of _Morphic_ meeting its goal and being printed!** 

**And if you haven’t already, please like the [“Morphic” Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/MorphicGraphicNovel/) and [subscribe to my mailing list!](http://eepurl.com/g8TzPb)**
I appreciate all the support. 

Thanks for reading and have a great weekend! I'll be back in two weeks with the next page.
