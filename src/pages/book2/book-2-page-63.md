## Buffer Status

So last month I finished a batch of four pages and this month of October, I am almost done with another batch! This means that **all the pages I will upload by the end of this year are done** and I should have five in the buffer when I go on break in December. Those five in the buffer should cover me until March. 

In November, I will clean up the next batch of Book 1 pages. I look forward to that! I will finally get some pages with Capri looking _really_ polished.

## Thanks for reading!
