One thing I wish I could convey more strongly in this page: Lily is not one who can be scared easily. 

## UPDATED PAGES AND NEW SPEECH BUBBLES

Along with this new page, I have uploaded 5 more revised pages in Book 1! 
Two of them had not previously been colored. 

Here are the pages: 
* [Page 13][1]
* [Page 14][2]
* [Page 15][3]
* [Page 16][4]
* [Page 17][5]

### New Font Family

I also recently experimented with new font and speech bubbles, which I will now implement in my comic pages from this day forward. 
I got the new font, Anime Ace 2, from [Blambot](https://blambot.com/collections/all-fonts/products/anime-ace-2), an excellent source for comic fonts and resources. 
They provide many fonts to independent comic creators for free (including the one mentioned).
I am extremely grateful for that, because I finally admit I can't create good custom typography for my own comics. _[Shrug]_

### New Speech Bubbles

I tried out a different style of speech bubbles that is much simpler and easier to read than my original style. 
Before, I used stroked ellipses because I needed something that people could read easily on the original black and white pages. 
I didn't bother trying to change the style when I started coloring pages, so I'll have to go back through all **100+ pages** to update the speech bubbles _and_ the font families. 

Oh well. It will be worth it. 

And I won't have to go back through these _ever again_. 
I am also scaling the files to the final image resolution for printing. 

### So how long until I finish the comic?

I certainly have my work cut out for me. 
I calculated the amount of time for me to finish all three books and have all the pages print-ready and I found that I could have everything done in three and a half years. 
**I aim to finish at the beginning of the year 2024 and run a Kickstarter campaign quickly following, printing everything as _one_ graphic novel.** 

### Time to promote _Morphic_

After _four years_ of working hard on this webcomic and perfecting my artistic style, I feel ready...
ready to start spreading the word about my comic beyond my circle of family and friends. 
I still have a few things to be done on the website before I really share it around, but I am taking steps behind the scenes to bring about those changes. 
I'll even be looking into how to make engaging newsletters for subscribers. 

Marketing isn't really my strongsuit, but I will need it in order to make the future Kickstarter a success. 
Besides, three years seems like _plenty_ of time for me to get my feet wet, try different ways of sharing the comic, and ultimately practice _convincing_ people that my comic is worth buying.

## Thanks for reading

This turned into another long post. Oh well.
