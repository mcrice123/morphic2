Me: [adds new comic page to website] Oh, I forgot! The air is all smoky, so she should be coughing. I'll just add that in real quick...

Me: [adds new version of comic page] Oh, I forgot! I decided to go with this other style for the telepathic speech bubbles and the ones on this page don't match _at all_...I better fix it.

Me: [finds a few old preview images that aren't up to date] Gosh darnit! 

## Why Hello!

I hope you're enjoying the story so far! I mapped out what the end of Book 2 will look like, so I can announce now with confidence that it will reach 74 pages. I started sketching my ideas for Book 3 and I look forward to finally tying up A LOT of loose ends. 

### Housekeeping

I decided, for the sake of clarity and simplicity, to refer to website maintenance and old page updates as "housekeeping". The label makes sense to me, since proper functionality of the website _and_ clear, legible, attractive pages are necessary for keeping an audience interested. But just like no one owns a home to do the housekeeping, so it is for me, a comic creator, that I don't create a webcomic just to redo pages and fix bugs. 

One of my newest housekeeping tasks is this: making my website as _accessible_ as possible, even to viewers who use screen readers. 

### Page Transcripts

Right now, there are only a few comic pages for which I added a detailed transcript that should be readable by screen readers. I estimate that it will take me months...yes, _months_...to transcribe all the comic pages on this site. 

**It really matters to me a lot that I can share my comic with _anyone_**, so I wish I could get these pages transcribed a lot sooner. It takes me around an hour to transcribe one comic page and I have well over 100 of them left to do. I have to compromise and work on the transcripts on the side. I might get done with transcribing around 10 pages between page updates (when I'm _not_ on a month-long break). 

What's worse for me is that I already worked on 40 page transcripts when I decided to make them more detailed, so I'll have to go back over all those transcripts...AGAIN. And at a much slower pace. I was making those transcripts in a format that was simpler for me, but after a lot of thought, **I decided it was worth the extra effort to provide a good listening experience on screen readers.** 

That being said, not only will you get a new page in the next post, you'll also get 10 more pages with clear transcripts. 

## Thanks for reading!
