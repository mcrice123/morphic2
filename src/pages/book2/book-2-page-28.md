It took almost _30_ pages for Errie to realize something's
wrong.

**But the pace picks up yet again!**

# Building up a Buffer

I'm currently working on the next two pages. Although I fully
expect to have next week's page done in time to upload, **I
made a goal to build up my buffer of pages again.**

Holidays are coming up and I want to try drawing up enough
pages to give me a few weeks' break from drawing. I would
still upload pages (except the week before Christmas, which
is an art upload), but I think I need some time off from
drawing around that time.

Now that I have more time than before Book 2 to work on
these pages, I'm beginning to feel 'fatigue'...nothing too
bad, but _I noticed it's gotten a bit harder to motivate me
to draw._ Having deadlines helps me in this case, but I know
I need to rest, so **I think I'll aim for taking a break
during the holiday season.**

Ultimately, taking time off from 'Morphic' will help me keep
going with it. At least, that's what I expect.

### Thanks for reading!

Come back next week to find out what Errie's doing!

Have a great weekend!
