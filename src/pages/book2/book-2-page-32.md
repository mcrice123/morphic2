YAY I DID IT!

This one took me a while! **Can you tell???** I couldn't talk myself out of
having to draw the water, _it was required by the plotline_.

But at least now one of Tenti's abilities is pretty obvious...and _hopefully_
it's obvious what's _NOT_ her ability. **No "FSSHH" sounds while she's running is a
dead giveaway.**

# Well, time for a break. Here's the plan.

I still have a lot of pages ahead of me to complete Book 2, so I'm taking as
good of a break as I can. I say this b/c a month ago I was toying with the idea
of doing some extra "fun" posts during my break. As cool as it sounded,
I knew I may lose motivation to keep it up.

That said, I'm limiting myself to just uploading **one single Christmas post**
and calling that good until the beginning of January. That way I can focus on
other things (like the holidays) and **return to page production in January _refreshed and
full of energy._**

### To sum it up...

This year,

- I **drew** and **colored** 32 pages of Book 2 and

- I **colored** (and redrew) about 10 pages of Book 1.

**I am now starting my break from uploading pages and it will last through the
beginning of January** (I'm aiming for the very beginning, but we'll see how that
turns out).

During this time, **I will plan on uploading one Christmas/holiday post** some
week prior to Christmas Day. I'll aim for uploading this post on **December 17th**.

### Thanks for reading!

I really enjoy sharing my comic with you! Please like/comment on the ["Morphic"
Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/MorphicGraphicNovel), I like to see people's feedback. I'll be back on Dec. 17th with
the special Christmas post, so in the meantime, **have a great weekend and a happy
Thanksgiving!**
