Errie is ready to go!

_Also, that **stone**...I tend to forget about it!_

It's like one of those little details that you know is
important but its ability to keep your interest wanes after
a while... **Like in Book 1, I didn't even remember to show
Errie putting it in her pocket.** She basically picked it up
and forgot all about it and **I _totally_ forgot** about it
until planning for Errie to find it again.

**Talk about 'confusing the audience'...** I knew I had to
supply some kind of explanation for the **_obvious unexplained
gap_** in the timeline of the stone's appearances, since I
failed to make it clear. Best fix I could think of was for
Errie to spell it out. Still, having some kind of visual
evidence of the stone being put in her pocket would have
been better.

Well, the nice thing is, I haven't reworked some of those
pages yet at that point in the plot, so I _might_ be able to
squeeze in an extra panel to convey where the stone ends up
...we'll see.

I felt silly enough about this little goof-up to make **one
of my major goals in Book 2 to show clearly _when Errie
has the stone._** It's usually
going to be in her pocket, but _now you know_ she remembered to
take it with her.

Anyway, that's my rant.

### Thanks for reading!

Come back next week to see what happens next! **Believe me, you
_don't_ want to miss it!** I'm very proud of the next page.

Have a great weekend!
