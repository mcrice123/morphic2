So while finalizing the script on this page, a familiar song
came to mind: "I'm a Believer", written by Neil Diamond and
sung by the Monkees. **I couldn't stop laughing.**

Also, **_NEW CHARACTER APPEARANCE!_** This will be fun... _[hehehe]_

### Sorry for late update

I've been crazy busy lately. Starting this week, I'll be
resuming a 2-page-per-week production schedule to build my
page buffer up again. My goal is to get enough pages stored
up to cover more than a month of weekly page updates.

Not going to focus too much on updating Book 1 pages, but I
might post one soon that I stopped in the middle of coloring.

### Thanks for reading!

Have a great weekend everybody! I'll post next week's page as
scheduled.
