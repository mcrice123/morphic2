_**Ooooooooooooooooooooooooo**_

Something's clearly up. Who listens to the radio while
switching loads?

# Anyway long time no see, Lane

One thing I've always liked about drawing Lane is how _easy_
her hairstyle is to draw. Or at least it feels that way. I
never had to use a photo reference for it.

In contrast, I've found that having references for drawing
Errie and her mother's hair more realistic.
Even with Chan's hair I struggled quite a bit to get it right.

### More colored pages!

Check out the newly colored pages of Book 1!

* [Book 1, Page 11](https://mcrice123.github.io/morphic/blog/book-1-page-11/)

* [Book 1, Page 69](https://mcrice123.github.io/morphic/blog/book-1-page-69/)

You'd probably like to know more about how I produce these
pages. I'm hoping to make a behind-the-scenes post about it
for celebrating **_Morphic_'s anniversary** coming up in
early September. It's still in the planning stages, but I
figured people would be interested and it's **not too
early to hype it up**.

### Thanks for reading!

And come back next week for more Lane! Have a great weekend!
