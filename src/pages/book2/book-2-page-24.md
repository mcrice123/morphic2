Behold...CAT MORPHICS

MEOW

_...also, cats are kind of hard to draw..._

# Happy Birthday, Morphic!

About two years ago, I launched "Morphic" and posted the
first 8 pages of "Morphic" Book 1 on a Facebook page. I don't
remember the exact date, but I remember drawing these first
pages in August, hurrying to get them done by the end of the
month, then posting them on the first weekend of September.
So I consider Sept 1st to be the birthday of "Morphic".

### In other news

1. There's no new colored Book 1 page this week. I'm
probably going to pause those updates until I'm done with
"How I Draw" posts. But I'm still going to work on them, so
I'll post whatever I get done all at once after finishing the
extra posts celebrating the birthday of "Morphic".

2. I did just post the last ready page in my buffer, BUT. I
I am in the middle of coloring the next two pages and I expect
to get them done this weekend (esp. since it's a 3-day
weekend, hehe). Therefore, I'm confident I'll have pages
ready for the next two regular page updates.

### Thanks for reading!

Check out next week's posts for Stage 2 of my drawing process
and more conversation with THE CATS!

Have a great Labor Day weekend!
