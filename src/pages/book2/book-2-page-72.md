In a desperate attempt to regain her balance, she holds out in front of her the smart phone in her left hand and at her side, she clenches her right. Cyan-blue waves appear in the background in the top left corner, but they fade out to reveal a black starry sky serving as a backdrop for the gold-colored surface of a planet partially visible in the bottom right corner of the panel.

## Upcoming changes

I'm not going to announce anything permanent right now, but I am considering some options on how to proceed with "Morphic" that could impact the posting schedule this year. I'm giving myself a month to think things over before I announce anything. 

In the meantime, I still have three more pages of Book 2 in the buffer and I am on my way to finalizing seven more pages in Book 1. 

Also, **Happy Easter!**

## Thanks for reading!

I appreciate all the support. 

I'll be back in two weeks with the next page. Have a great weekend!
