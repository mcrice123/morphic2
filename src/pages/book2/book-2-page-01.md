# First colored Morphic page ever!

Welcome back from the intermission! Hope you like the new character and the new coloring style.

I managed to finish coloring page 2 and now I'm coloring pages 3 and 4 (got all the other drawing
for those pages done and only the coloring is left).

I'm pleased with my progress so far, but now Spring Break is over and I have to buckle down for
the second half of the semester. I expect the school/work pace will pick up from here on out.
No worries, though! I expect I'll keep up with the update schedule. I only need four more pages
to ensure that the schedule is covered until classes are over for the summer. I think I can push that.

**In the meantime---enjoy the colors!** And thanks for reading! Return next week to find out who
Vix is talking to.
