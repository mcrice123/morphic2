Sorry for the **_really_** late update!

I've had a lot to balance this week, including how to proceed as far as
uploading pages goes. I thought long an hard on this particular topic and I
came to a decision. **After I upload page 32, I'll begin my break from drawing
pages, to be resumed the beginning of January.**

My main two reasons for choosing to take a break early consist of:

1) Drawing fatigue, and

2) Busy schedule in November.

I definitely welcome the upcoming "hiatus", but I wanted to be done with my
current pages so that they're not sitting for weeks/months unfinished. Page 32
is currently waiting to have both text and colors added to it, ~~but I think I
could get it done this week...~~ **but due to crammed schedule this week, I'm
giving myself until the week _after_ this upcoming weekend to finish it.**


Ever since I made my decision to stop after page 32, I got this stubborn eagerness
to finish 31 and 32. This is **good**, since before I was lacking motivation to even
draw. My trouble **now** is trying to get pages done by a certain deadline, so I
have to tread carefully and set realistic goals for myself.

If I don't have page 32 done next weekend, I'll upload something else "Morphic"-
related.

### Thanks for reading!

I am grateful to have readers to share my story with, so **thank you** for
following my comic and I'll post again next weekend!

Have a great weekend!
