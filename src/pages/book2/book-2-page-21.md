_YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYeah._ Something's up.

# It's been a busy week

I got two more pages colored like I expected to, so my page
buffer is now up to 3 pages, as predicted. However, that
was all I was I able to finish this week.

**I don't have another Book 1 page ready to update, but I
think I'll have better luck next week.**  

Until then...

### Thanks for reading!
Come back next week to see the last
page of this scene.

Have a great weekend!
