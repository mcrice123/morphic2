# The Burning Question

Errie's a little surprised to be regaining her mother's
trust so quickly.

### A Small update

Before last week, I was producing two colored pages per week
for Book 2, with the intent of reaching a buffer of 8 pages.
Since last week, I decided to slow down to producing one
page per week, settling for a buffer of 5 pages.

...Or, rather 3 pages currently. I'm still working on the
two latest pages.

### But hey---Another Colored Page for Book 1!

Check out [page 34][1]
of Book 1!

### Thanks for reading!

Check out next week's post for the wrap-up of this scene!

...*And* maybe another colored page for Book 1, if I have
time.

Have a great weekend!
