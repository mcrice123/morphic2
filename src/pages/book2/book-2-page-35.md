# The mighty Catius fights Squid Lady!!!

_And then he's caught..._

**_...uh oh._**

### Another page up as promised!

Last month has been busy! **I'm almost finished with the next 3 pages in Book 2.** I also got done flatting **16 pages** in Book 1! Those are all the remaining pages that still needed needed it. This month I'll focus on applying local colors to all pages that haven't been colored yet...as well as starting another batch of Book 2 pages!

### Page Highlight

I got to experiment with coloring the water dripping down the wall. **I'm happy that I got it to look somewhat realistic!** Because water is weird. It's hardly there, but it's shiny and it makes things look darker than usual.

### Thanks for reading!

I hope the month of July treated you well! My next page update is 2 weeks from now, so don't forget to come back and see what happens next!
