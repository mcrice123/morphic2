Oh _that's_ what kind of Morphic she is...

This was actually my first time drawing _vampire bats_. It was fun!

## Breaks are good!

For almost a week, I got to work on something other than comic pages. 
**I have a new website in the works that I started a while back and I got a lot done on it this week.**
There's still a lot to do on it, but I'm hoping to have it ready in a month or two. 
I keep noticing bugs on this site every now and then, so the sooner I'm not relying solely on this site, the better. 

### Thanks for reading!

I'll be back in two weeks with the next page! I'll also give an update on the progress I'm making on old Book 1 pages. 

Stay healthy and have a Happy Easter!
