Dancing around the question. I've watched so many
investigation dramas, but making one is pretty fun.

# Another Colored Page

Check out [page 16](https://mcrice123.github.io/morphic/blog/book-1-page-16/) of Book 1!

If you're wondering how I'm choosing which pages to work on,
basically I'm starting out with the pages that need the most
alteration. Thus, I'm getting a lot of pages at the beginning
of Book 1 refinished first before those in the last half.

I divided the pages into two categories: pages that need
redrawing of the line art and pages that don't need changes
to the line art. I'm pretty much going through the former
in order from oldest to newest, but I'll be going through the
latter from newest to oldest, so that new readers' experiences
aren't jarred as much by old black-and-white pages (it's
typical of ongoing webcomics to still have old pages at the
beginning of the first chapter or book, rather than the end).

While I'm refinishing these pages, I'll also be fixing
spelling mistakes, adjusting fonts, redrawing speech bubbles...
everything that helps give Book 1 the facelift that it needs.

**And I'm enjoying the process of finally coloring these
pages. I dreamed for a long time to see them in color.**

### Thanks for reading!
