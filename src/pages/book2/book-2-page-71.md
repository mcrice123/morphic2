_Created in Clip Studio Paint_

It sure is fun to draw characters as they react to odd situations. How often do _you_ nearly collide with someone getting thrown out of the ground?

## Behind the Scenes: Status Update

I am _almost_ finished with a 4-page comic that I've been working on for the past four weeks. I don't intend to share it publicly any time soon, since I'll be keeping it to start my private portfolio, but I am really happy with how it's turned out! I created it with Clip Studio and I took my time learning how to use the tools it offers and WOW...I am _not_ going back to GIMP. **This is better.**

And I will only go back to Photoshop if I have to. I know that a lot of artists use that as their main software of choice, so if I colloborate with those artists, I would have to use it. 

**But Clip Studio is AMAZING.** I recommend checking it out if you're interested in making comics.

That's all for now! Until next post...
