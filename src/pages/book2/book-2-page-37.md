## New faces!

Meet Meppie and Stella! 

Despite their small roles in the story, I've been looking forward to introducing them---_Meppie_ in particular. I like Meppie. **She's my kind of hero...calm and collected, even in emergencies.**

..._Most_ emergencies. 

She appears a little alarmed on this page, but that just says something about the situation. 

### Where I am at with Book 1

I'm almost done with coloring in the base colors of all the pages! I'm going to finish the last one today.

Next week, I will start shading. My first goal is to shade up to 10 pages in one month. I'll let you know how the progress goes!

### Where I am at with Book 2

I just finished inking pages 39 through 42. By the next page update, I should have the text, flatting and base colors done on all of them and the shading started on some.

## Thanks for reading!

I'll be back in 2 weeks with the next page! Have a great Labor day weekend!
