**AH!**

It's a _HAND...!_

...

So glad I could reveal this part of the story, despite the suspense it creates. 
I don't consider myself a fan of horror movies, but I wanted to weave _some_ kind of thriller-suspense into the plot. 

...Not a _lot_ of it, of course. 
I'm writing this story for people like me, who wimp out at the sight of creepy hands, creepy clowns, and bloody weapons. 

Well now that I'm on the subject, FYI **I aim to keep this comic PG-13 (TV), goshdarnit!** _Very_ minimal blood (if any) and...no foul language. 

Just farmer-isms, like the one I just used two sentences ago. 

_Anyway..._

## Book 2 news

I haven't started shading and lighting the next 2 pages. _[Groan]_

I'm planning on working on page 41 today, but **I'm also in the middle of producing pages 43 through 46.** 
I got penciling and inking done on all of them.
I also _just_ finished the text stage on 2 of them. 
So this coming week I'll be finishing text, flatting and filling in local colors. 

...All while finishing page 41 in the next two weeks, to post it on time. 

## Book 1

Still on hold. I'll pick this back up in November. 

## Game plan

My goal is to get all these Book 2 pages I mentioned finished by the end of October.
**There are only 3 post days left** before December, when I take my break from posting "Morphic" pages. 
**So pages 41, 42, and 43 will go up before I go on break**, leaving 3 pages in the buffer for posting when I come back in January. 

**I'm also still hoping to upload a bunch of FINISHED Book 1 pages before I go on break.**
Production on _that_ got a little slow, however, so that's why I'm focusing on Book 2. 
I'll talk more about it on the next post. 

## Thanks for reading!

Have a great weekend! I'll be back in 2 weeks.
