Hmmm...where have we seen that wolf before...?

And oh yeah, now we know the Fox is a she.

# Short Post

I'm a little busy this weekend, so I'll just give a quick status update.
I have pages finished up to page 6 now---WOW. I was on fire this week with
pages 5 and 6. If I can manage to get the next two done next week, I'm set
for the rest of the semester. Of course, I want to get more done than that,
but at least the pressure to keep up with the page upload schedule is
minimal.

**Thanks for reading! Return next week to see more of these two cool characters!**
