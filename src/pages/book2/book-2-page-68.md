_Heheh..."Billy" the "kid". GET IT?_

The only way I could pull more puns out of this page would be to dress this "kid" up as a cowboy. Fortunately for you, I held to my decision made months ago that he look _as close to Capri_ as possible...

However...

I had to try this...

WHAT HAVE I DONE.

## Almost there...

I am wrapping up a few tasks today. I finished what were to be the last four pages of Book 2 and I am close to wrapping up **THE last page**, which I added after feeling good vibes from working with Clip Studio. After today, I can say that I got **five pages** done this month, bringing the page total up to 75 for Book 2. That's one more than Book 1's original page count, which is now at 68. 

So the total so far is...143 pages. 

Hmmmm. [Pauses to stare at that number.]

That's a lot of pages...**I deserve an extra break now.** But don't worry, I won't take it until I post all the pages for Book 2. And even then, I will still be working on stuff in the background...I just won't post anything for a month.

And it looks like the last post will be in May...and since I take a month-long break in June, that will be two months back-to-back when I won't post any new pages. 

_[Sigh]_ And then finally, Book 3 will begin. The final chapter.

## Thanks for reading!
