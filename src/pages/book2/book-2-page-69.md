_Hmmm...who's "Nascha"? [Sounds familiar.](https://www.morphicwebcomic.com/book2/book-2-page-02/)_

## Change of plans

I had announced in my last post my plans for taking a break from posting pages for a month, around the month of June. My intention was to keep working on "Morphic" behind the scenes during that "month off". However, since my last post, I observed that my enthusiasm for working on "Morphic" is pretty low and a change is needed in order to continue. Sorry if this sounds confusing, but the update schedule will continue as planned. The only change is that I'll be working on something else for the next four weeks.

The reason for this change is simply that I started to dread working on "Morphic" again. It's still my passion project. I'm still set on finishing it, but I think it's around this time of year that I notice a change in my motivation. This happened last year too. It's like reflection on what I did last year and planning for this year gets me frustrated with keeping my schedule the same. 

What doesn't help is that, even with shorter time spent on comic pages, it's still going to take me at least two years (at best) to finish all of "Morphic". That's disheartening too, because I really want to create other comics...some long, some short. 

I can wait to do those, of course. I just wish I didn't have to. **When I'm done with "Morphic", I can say that I had been working on comics for...seven, eight years?** And if all I have to show for it is "Morphic"...somehow that doesn't seem satisfying to me. That's a long time to spend on one project, no matter how long it is. **I'd feel a lot better having one short comic in addition to that, even if I spend only one month on it.** Given how far-off the completion of "Morphic" is, I don't mind adding a one-month delay to it.

## So that's what I'll be doing!

I'll start and finish a short comic, up to four pages long, that's not affiliated with "Morphic". Totally different universe.

And I'll share news on the outcome in the middle of March! 

YAY.
