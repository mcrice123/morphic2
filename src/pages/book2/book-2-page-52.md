Wolf sure likes to zoom around _a lot!_ 

## Still making progress on Book 1

Forgot to mention in my last post what my April goal is. 
I'm shading and finalizing six pages from the very beginning of Book 1! 
**So far I have 2 out of 6 pages finalized and I expect to be done with those within a week.**
Then I'll take a short break before starting on more pages for Book 2. 

I'll upload the updated pages of Book 1 along with the next scheduled post for Book 2. 
**Therefore, in two weeks you'll get a new page to read _and_ six updated pages in Book 1 to look at!**

### Thanks for reading!

I hope everyone is staying healthy and safe! 
These sure are strange times. 

Have a great weekend!
