**OUT INTO THE SUN AT LAST!**

I got two more pages drawn and inked this week---**_YAY!_**
I expect to have those done by the end of next week.

#  Colored Page 15 is up!

Check out [page 15 of Book 1][1] to see
the new changes!

Also, I'm _hoping_ this is a local server issue when I
'test run' the post, but in case it is also an issue with
the public-side of the website...well. Let's just say, try
as I might, I couldn't re-orient page 15 of Book 1 into
portrait layout---**which is WEIRD**. The file shows up in the
correct orientation and I open it in another app and it
displays correctly, but then I run the server and **WHAT
the WHAT** is going on?!

So if it shows up that way when you browse to it, **yeah,
that's a bug**. I'll know about _that_ one anyway...

However...

### Please let me know if you notice any other pages displaying wrong

This is the first and only page I had issues with...I'm wondering
if it's a bug from an update. I'll be looking into that, but
any feedback on Facebook or on the comments below (or Github, if
you fancy) is appreciated.

**_UPDATE:_ Fixed page 15! Looks like it was an OS problem
on my side. My image wasn't displaying in its true orientation
except the times I worked on it in GIMP and uploaded it
to the site. I literally look at it in its file folder and on
other apps on my laptop and it wouldn't be showing the image
in the same orientation as on GIMP or online.**

**So _that_ was confusing! I never had this issue before. I
did install a new version of GIMP and finished page 15 with
that version. Something must have changed in the way GIMP
exports image files.**

**OH WELL. Now I know what the problem is and how to prevent
it from now on.** (8/25/18)

### Thanks for reading!

Come back next week to see who's talking in that last panel!
Also, I'll be posting an extra something, celebrating
**2 years** since I first started drawing "Morphic"! Stay
tuned and have a great weekend!
