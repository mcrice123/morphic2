                    <p>
                        I will print the completed webcomic as a 200+ page graphic novel and I will hold a crowdfund campaign on Kickstarter to fund the printing by the <strong>end of 2024</strong>.

                    <h2>Plot</h2>

                    <p>
                        A plea for help from a mysterious girl sidetracks <strong className="no-break">Errie Bright</strong>&#42; and <strong className="no-break">Lane Valerie</strong> on their way to a local festival. Although they expect to see people dressed up as animals for the event, the girls soon realize that the people they meet in the woods that day are <em>not in costume...</em>
                    </p>

                    <p>They are shape-shifting beings called <strong>morphics</strong>.</p>

                    <h2>Background</h2>

                    <p>
                        I wrote the first draft and began drawing lineart pages in 2016. From 2018 onwards, I started uploading pages in full-color and I am still in the process of coloring old pages. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I draw the pages with black fineliner ink pen and use <a href="https://www.gimp.org/" target="_blank">GIMP</a> to add speech bubbles and cell shading.
