    'The screen door clicks shut and its brass handle swings up as Errie stands in full view on the short concrete walkway, facing the viewer. Her hands, though resting on her hips, are hidden by the red cardboard wings on her arms. The hood of her red jacket still covers her straight red hair. She looks out across the green sunlit lawn with a calm smile.',

    'Errie stands in front of a small patch of dirt surrounded by (clockwise starting from the left) the front step in front of the screen door, the gray house, the driveway, and the walkway. A green fir plant in a large yellow pot sits on the dirt near the front step. Hanging directly above the plant and centered vertically on the house is a black metal mailbox with a lid on top and hooks underneath. Large metal numbers that read "456" hang above the mailbox, each number hanging slightly lower than the one to its left.',

    'Lost in thought, the red-haired teenager looks down and to her left, her smile disappearing from her face. Only her head and shoulders are visible.',

    'Panel 4.',

    'A shot looking down at a pair of feet standing on concrete shows that the feet are clothed in purple-black tennis shoes and topped slightly with blue jeans cut off at the very bottom of the panel. The concrete pavement covers the bottom half of the panel and the rest of the panel is covered with green grass. On the right side of the panel and sitting among blades of grass near the edge of the lawn, is a marble-sized white sphere enveloped in a light purple glow.',
