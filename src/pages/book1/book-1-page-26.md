    '"That makes sense--" Errie starts to reply, but she hears a fluttering noise ("FLA-FA-FA-FLA-FLAP") and blurts out, "HUH?"',

    'A view from behind the two girls shows them to turn towards the center of the panel to look behind them. Errie now stands upright on the left side of the panel and Lane stands to the right, holding up her left fist. Her snake mask still hands by its elastic string in the crook of her left elbow.',

    'A small red bird perches on the green grass in a zoomed-out shot of the woods where Errie and Lane emerged moments before. Not a lot of detail can be seen from far away, but a slithering vine also emerges from behind a small tree and curls through the grass some distance behind the bird. A green glow envelops the vine.',

    'On the right side of the panel, the vine makes a loud creak as it sneaks up on the red bird in a zoomed-in view. The closer look at the bird, which perches on the left side of the panel, reveals that it is a red cardinal and its yellow beak turns to the right, in the direction of the noise.',

    'Panel 4.',

    '"KRHEEEE!" shrieks the bird as its wings flutter. A snap is heard as the glowing vine lunges after the red cardinal from the right side of the panel. The vine almost touches the bird as it takes off from the grass.',

    'Panel 5.',
    "\n",
    'The red cardinal continues to shriek ("KRHEE-EE-EE-EE") as it soars up from the right side of the panel, over the two teenagers on the left side of the panel. , Errie looks down in alarm toward the bottom right of the panel as Lane, behind her, looks up in astonishment at the bird. The red-haired girl holds out her left arm in surprise. The strips of duct tape strapping the cardboard wing to her red jacket sleeve are almost completely visible.',

    'Panel 6.',
    "\n",
    'The girls appear as silhouetted figures in a zoomed-out view from the perspective of the vines now creeping through the grass from the bottom of the panel. The vines have different shades of green and variety in leaf shapes, but they are all enveloped in the same green glow and emit a rushing sound ("FSH-SH-SH-SH-SH").',
    "\n",
    'The silhouetted figures appear small and just above the center of the panel, standing in front of the similarly-silhouetted bridge, which is partially visible from over the expanse of green grass separating the silhouettes from the vines.',
