    'A word box at the top left reads "15 Minutes Later...".',

    'Lane',"'",'s head and shoulders appear on the left side of the panel facing away from the viewer, directing attention to the right side of the panel, where Errie appears in the background on her hands and knees, coughing. Disturbed ashes float up around her.',

    "\n",
    '"Are you ALRIGHT?" asks Lane.',
    "\n",

    'Panel 5.',
    "\n",
    '"That PEBBLE--!" she exclaims from off-screen. A small sphere, like a marble, rests among the blades of grass that show up clearly like a disc among the otherwise uniform coating of ashes over the ground. Errie asks out loud, "Did that just drop out of my--?"',
    "\n\n",

    'Panel 6.',
    "\n",
    '"Oh yeah!" continues the redhead, appearing on the left side of the panel as she straightens up and peers to her left at Lane. She holds up the stone in her cupped left hand and explains, "I stuck it in my pocket and forgot!"',
    "\n",
    'On the right side of the panel, Lane leans forward with her hands on her knees and peers at the stone. "Do you collect rocks?" she asks with a confused look on her face.',

    "\n\n",

    'Panel 7.',
    "\n",
    '"Wait, don',"'",'t you remember that girl who--" starts the redhead, in a close-up of her face when a look of alarm suddenly covers it. "WAIT A MINUTE!" she exclaims, staring dumbfoundedly into space towards the left side of the panel. "--SHE GLOWED!!! And had WINGS!!!"',
