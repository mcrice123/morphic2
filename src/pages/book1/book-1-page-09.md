In front of the woman, sits three students among the two columns of table-like desks currently in view within the panel. The students in the front row, a light-skinned girl with straight brown hair and a dark-skinned boy with black curly hair, turn to look in the direction of the viewer. The third student, a light-skinned boy with blonde hair, sits in the desk behind the dark-skinned boy and in front of the viewer, but continues to face the chalkboard. All three students wear orange vests over white dress shirts and sit in wooden chairs. The girl at the front of the class has a burgundy satchel leaning against one of the legs of her desk.',
