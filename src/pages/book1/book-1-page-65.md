    '"Sorry again for all that!" says Canissandro, who suddenly appears between the two teenagers while enveloped in a glow that extends to the right, suggesting that he zoomed behind them from that direction. Sirena',"'",'s pigtails and the top of her head are visible in the foreground, at the bottom of the panel. To his right, Lane frowns up at the man with the ponytail as he wipes the tears from his eyes and continues, "It won',"'",'t happen again in your lifetime--I ASSURE you!"', 
    "\n",
    '"WAIT--" Errie blurts out as she peers up at the morphic in alarm.',

    '"--And you don',"'",'t have to warn your town now!" shouts Canissandro from off-screen.',

    'Only two silhouettes appear in a zoomed-out view of the clearing. Two streaks of glow extend from the center of the panel to the left ("FWIP! FWIP!"), one short one overlapping Lane',"'",'s figure in the foreground and one tall one behind her in the background. On the right, Errie',"'",'s figure faces the left, raises her arm, and yells, "HEY!"',

    'A person',"'",'s right arm extends from the top right corner of the panel toward the bottom center, his palm flat and facing the viewer. A butterfly flutters toward the outstretched hand from the grass a few inches below. Faint traces of veins can be seen on the person',"'",'s arm, as well as the edge of a loose-fitting sleeve stopping at his forearm. The grass itself appears darkened by a new dusting of black particles.',

    'Panel 4.',
    "\n",
    'Capri appears with his hand close to the viewer, holding up the butterfly resting on his folded fingers. His tear-stained eyes appear dry as he peers down peacefully at the butterfly. The black veins on his face have almost entirely disappeared. Black particles drift down like snow in the air around him.',

    '"My siblings AREN',"'",'T all bad," he says with an accent. "...And neither am I."',
    "\n",
    'The clearing appears dark around him, covered in large piles of black particles and dead vines disintegrating from view. For the first time, Capri appears without vines coming out of his back.',
