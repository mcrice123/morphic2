    'Panel 1.',
    "\n",
    'An orange-haired teenage boy walks toward the viewer down a hallway lined on either side with gray full-height lockers. The hallway itself is almost perfectly centered in the panel, so that the edges of the lockers, the edges of the overhead lights, and the joining of the mustard-colored walls and ceiling all radiate from the middle of the panel. The orange-haired boy walks just to the right of the center, with his right hand in his pants pocket and his left hand holding his dark gray smartphone. He wears a white buttoned shirt with front pockets and khakis. His shirt is untucked.',
    "\n\n",

    'Panel 2.',
    "\n",
    'The orange-haired boy continues to walk with his eyes fixed on his smartphone. As he holds up his right hand to press his finger against the screen, he approaches the end of the wall to his right, behind which a person hides, wearing a green snake mask and a green hoodie. The yellow eyes on the snake mask gaze in the direction of the viewer as the orange-haired boy begins to pass the hidden figure, oblivious to his surroundings.',
    "\n\n",

    'Panel 3.',
    "\n",
    '"S-S-S-SNAKE ATTACK!" yells the person wearing the snake mask, raising her dark-skinned hands and jumping forward.',
    "\n",
    'The orange-haired boy jerks his head back in alarm, looking up at the person in surprise.',
    "\n",
    '"Wha--?" he mutters and then blurts out, "WHOA!"',
    "\n\n",

    'Panel 4.',
    "\n",
    '"BOO!" yells Errie, jumping up behind the orange-haired boy with her arms raised. She now wears a red jacket with red cardboard wings duct-taped to her arms, a yellow t-shirt, and blue jeans. Her red bangs peek out from under her red hood.',
    "\n",
    'The orange-haired boy turns his head toward her with widened eyes, yelling, "GAH!"',
    "\n\n",

    'Panel 5.',
    "\n",
    'The orange-haired boy lowers his hands (still holding his smartphone) and glares with narrowed eyes at Errie.',
    "\n",
    '"Ugh...It',
    "'",
    's YOU GUYS..." mutters the boy.',
    "\n",
    'Errie, with her eyes closed on her smiling face, replies, "YUP! Heheh." Her arms are lowered also, but she holds her right cardboard-wing-clad arm to her chest.',
