    'Panel 1.',
    "\n",
    'A zoomed out view facing the front of the house shows Errie on the left pointing to the left side of the panel as she stands facing the glowing girl, who stands on the driveway a few feet away. The latter, still enveloped in a purple glow, hides her face with her hands. She stands to the right in full view, wearing off-white capris and brown flats with her purple shirt. Her folded grey wings extend to her knees and her white hair falls around her shoulders.',
    "\n",
    'Errie asks in purple-outlined speech bubbles, "The woods over THERE?"',
    "\n",
    'The girl answers in her accent, "YES! Please, you',
    "'",
    've got to help him!!!"',
    "\n",
    'She sobs.',

    'Panel 2.',
    "\n",
    'Errie turns to look behind her. The panel shows her close up with only her head and shoulders showing.',
    "\n",
    'Errie speaks again, but now with the purple outline fading from around her speech bubbles, "What kind of trouble is he in? ... MISS?"',
    "\n\n",

    'Panel 3.',
    "\n",
    'The view zooms out and shows Errie at an angle parallel to the house, but from the direction of the driveway. The teenager stands against a backdrop of green lawn and the edge of the woods. She looks in the direction of the viewer in surprise. The glowing girl is nowhere to be seen.',
    "\n\n",

    'Panel 4.',
    "\n",
    'Errie stands centered in the panel with eyes wide open in alarm and staring straight at the viewer. The panel has no frame and the background gradient of white onto bluegreen with some yellow extends to some of the surrounding margins. The closeup on Errie extends to the bottom of the page, where her elbows and the top of her cardboard wings are visible.',
    "\n",
    'Errie says out loud, "O-KAYYYY...where did she go?"',
