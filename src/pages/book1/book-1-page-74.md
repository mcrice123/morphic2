    'Panel 1.',
    "\n",
    'The panel takes up the entire page. The view focuses on a variety of objects standing on a polished wooden surface. Just behind the objects, a smooth, light-colored wall provides the backdrop. The wall itself is partially in shadow, growing dark at the top left of the panel, causing focus to shift back to the objects in the foreground.',
    "\n",
    'On the left, a simple black frame surrounds the photo of a young red-headed girl with shoulder-length hair. Visible from the shoulders, up, the girl wears a blue and yellow sweater, a purple bow in her hair, and a smile on her face. Behind the frame, the edge of the wooden surface appears between the frame and the left panel border. Behind the surface',"'",'s edge, part of a leather furniture item leans against the wall. The piece of furniture is reddish in color and part of a ring of gold studs lines its rounded edge.',
    "\n",
    'Behind the black frame and near the center of the panel, sits a jar filled with pieces of paper, reflecting the glare of yellow lamplight that falls over the items. Inside, one of the pieces of paper bears bolded handwriting that reads "MISS YOU DAD". Directly behind the jar stands a figurine of a smiling lady holding a basket of flowers. Her bare blonde hair cascades behind her head as she turns her head toward her right, towards the viewer, while she holds her basket of pink flowers on her right arm. The jar obscures the dress she is wearing, but the viewer can barely make out the white color of her full skirt through the glass. The blue sash over her shoulders completes the outfit.',
    "\n",
    'Also standing in front of the jar, on the right side of the panel, stands a large gray frame holding a photo of a family. Twice as tall as the black frame, the rectangular frame holds a round convex shape and centers around a narrower inner border, gold in color and etched with a simple dotted design, that frames the photo.',
    "\n",
    'The family portrayed in the gray frame shows a man, a woman and a young girl smiling for the camera. The man stands on the right, wearing a green polo shirt, brown hair, and a brown mustache. He holds the woman close to him, with his right arm resting on her right shoulder. She has shoulder-length red hair and wears a white-button shirt under her purple pullover. Both the man and the woman hold either hand of the young girl in front of them. A pink headband holds back her red hair, which doesn',"'",'t curl up at the ends like the girl',"'",'s hair in the other photo. She wears a yellow shirt under her blue overalls and her eyes are closed as she smiles.',
    "\n",
    'The remaining few items in view consist of the blue-green glass coaster, horizontally centered in the panel and sitting in front of the two frames, and the bottom corner of a narrow gold frame in front of the gray frame, cut off by the right panel border so that the viewer cannot make out the photo. A tiny ridge in the polished wooden surface runs across the bottom of the panel, angled slightly higher on the left than on the right.',
    "\n",
    'A word box at the bottom right of the panel reads "END OF BOOK 1".',
