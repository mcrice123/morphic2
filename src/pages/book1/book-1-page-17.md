    'Chan pulls back his orange hood as he walks to the right side of the panel, closer to the viewer. The locker behind him indicates that he is heading back down the hallway lined with lockers. In the background, the two teenage girls grin as they watch him leave. Errie stands to the left with her back to the viewer as she looks behind her. Lane stands in the middle of the panel with her hands raised as if to amplify her voice.',

    'Lane shouts in reply, "WILL DO! Save some energy for TOMORROW!"',

    '"You',

    've got the BEST remote-control car out there, Chan!" shouts Errie, raising her right hand to her mouth.',

    'Still wearing the red-painted cardboard cut-out wings on her arms, the redheaded girl stands on the left side of the panel as Lane on the right bends over to pull up her limegreen messenger bag by its strap. She also holds her green snake mask by its elastic band.',

    '"YEAH, MAKE US PROUD!" yells the girl in the green hoodie.',

    'Lane leads the way in an outdoor shot of the two girls exitting a gray building. She and Errie walk away from two sets of double doors set against a wall in shadow. Two walls adjacent to the first one tower above both sides of the concrete pavement leading away from the doors. Green lawn begins where the left wall stops half-way down the pavement. Lane carries her limegreen messenger bag on her right side and Errie carries her pink backpack on her back. The two girls approach the sunny area of the pavement.',

    'Panel 4.',

    'A view shows two sidewalks along a street running parallel to the top and bottom panel borders. In the foreground, a small sliver of green grass lines the sidewalk and the bottom of the panel. Lining the sidewalk on the other side of the street stands two buildings, a gray one on the left with windows and a door and a pink one on the right with a door, an obscured neon sign, and a purple awning overshadowing a large display window. Cakes are visible behind the glass of the display window and an "OPEN" sign hangs on the door of the pink building. The two buildings are separated by an alleyway cluttered with trash cans.',
    "\n",
    'On the sidewalk in the foreground walk Lane and Errie towards the left side of the panel. Behind them, four figures stand talking. A boy in a cowboy hat holds back a large gray dog by a leash connected to its harness as the creature barks at the girls walking by. Next to him, stands the tallest and biggest figure, a man wearing a yellow sombrero, a brown vest, a white button shirt tucked into blue jeans, and brown cowboy boots with spurs. He has his arms held out palms up as he shouts at the figure next to him, a tall, shirtless dark-skinned man wearing mustard-colored fringed pants, boots, and a white feather with a black tip sticking up out of his ponytail. This man stands with a smile on his face and his arms crossed as he faces the man in the sombrero hat. Behind him, a shorter man with a cowboy hat, a light blue shirt, a blue vest, and brown chaps leans against a metal phone pole with his left hand and looks down at a phone he holds in his right.',
