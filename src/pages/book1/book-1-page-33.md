    'Three long vines enveloped in a limegreen glow curl among the blades of grass amid loud rustling. The longest of these vines curves first to the right and then to the left, then right again, until it nearly reaches the edge of the clearing in the background, where the grass stops and bushes and trunks grow, blocking the sunlight so that it appears pitch dark behind them.',

    'Panel 5.',
    "\n",
    'A view from in front of the girls shows only their legs as they stand in the background on the right side of the panel, cut off by the panel border. In the foreground and on the left side of the panel, only the bottom half of a person sitting cross-legged is visible, from the shoulders down. His back faces the viewer and he wears a white loose-fitting shirt with sleeves rolled up near his elbow. Only his right leg, clothed in brown pants, can be seen over the vines protruding from a hole in the back of his shirt. The hole itself is pitch black and a large variety of vines emerge from it, most like tentacles from a squid, some like tree branches. One of the latter and a few of the former extend towards the viewer, as the rustling continues. The limegreen glow shines brightly around the sitting figure and the vines.',
