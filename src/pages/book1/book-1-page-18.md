    'Against a backdrop of buildings walk two silhouettes carrying bags. They emerge from behind a blue car parked next to the sidewalk and in front of a green building with red awnings on its windows. On the building',"'",'s left stands a taller brown building with tall windows and beyond that a purple building disappearing from view. To the right of the green building stands a navy blue, slightly shorter, one with a mural depicting a large light-blue hand reaching down from the top right corner of the building to the center with a clenched fist, from which yellow lightning bolts radiate. A white sign above a door on its left side reads, "ASHROOT STUDIO". A red brick building to the right of that one is partially obscured by the panel cutoff.',

    'Several vehicles are parked in the two-way street. In the foreground, a red truck with a white roof sits next to the sidewalk on the side of the street closer to the viewer, on the right side of the panel. Also on the right side of the panel but parked on the far side of the street is a yellow step van with yellow and red text wrapped across the side of it that reads, "ALL DAY PANCAKES". Red and yellow lines parallel to the text run diagonally across the side of the step van and horizontally across the back of it. Three figures stand in the street near the open driver side door: a bearded, dark-skinned man with a red ball cap and dirty white apron, a man with his back to the viewer wearing a lion',

    's tail with earth-tone colored clothing, and a woman wearing a pink wig and a blue skin-tight outfit lined with bright green feathers around the neck, waist, and arms.',
    "\n",
    'The sidewalk closest to the viewer only shows on the left side of the panel, due to the angle of the shot. On it, a black rectangular merchandise stand obscures the view of the blue car and brown building in the background. Dozens of colorful animal-themed masks hang on display upon the two sides of the stand visible to the viewer. Two yellow signs on top of the stand read "MASKS" and "HATS". In front of the stand, a woman with a light purple shirt wears cat ears over her brown hair and a cat tail tucked into her blue jeans. She bends slightly to help a girl wearing a white jacket and pink pants put on a white hat with bunny ears. A tall man wearing a brown fedora hat, a green t-shirt, and orange cargo shorts stands near them appearing to count money.',

    'Panel 2.',
    "\n",
    'The back of the yellow step van appears smaller in the background in a shot centered on a sidewalk, to the left of which the step van is parked. A red brick building and a navy blue building line the right side of the sidewalk and recede into the background. An alleyway littered with cans partially separate the red brick building and a brown brick building  showing in the foreground, also lining the right side of the sidewalk.',

    'On the left side of the panel and passing in front of the brown brick building walk the two teenage girls. Errie, positioned closer to the edge of the sidewalk, holds the strap of her pink backpack currently slung over her back. She still wears the red painted cardboard cutout wings on her arms, the red jacket, the yellow shirt underneath, and blue jeans. She also wears black tennis shoes and her hood is still pulled over her red hair. She looks toward the right side of the panel as her smiling companion, to her left, bumps into her to avoid collison with a band of children rushing past. Lane continues to wear her green hoodie (with the hood down) and light blue capris. She also wears white shoes on her feet and gray headphones over her short black curls. Her limegreen messenger bag hangs against her right side from its single strap over her right shoulder. She grasps the strap with both hands, revealing the green snake mask hanging from its elastic band on her left arm.',

    'The pre-teen girl that Lane dodges wears a dark blue, puffy coat with a hood partially hiding her face. Attached to the back of the hood is a fin and the side is marked with white, similar to that of a killer whale. She swerves toward the right side of the panel to avoid running into Lane, followed by a chain of two children grasping each other',

    'Holding the whale girl',
    "'",
    's right hand is a young boy wearing a green raincoat lined up the back with triangular spikes. The spikes also line the top of a green dinosaur tail attached to the back of the raincoat. The boy', "'", 's face shows under the green hood as he turns to look at the even smaller child behind him, whose hand he holds in his right. The words "COME ON!" are scribbled next to the boy', "'", 's mouth.',
    "\n",
    'The small child, a girl wearing a tiny pink peacoat topped with pointed pink ears on its hood and to which a curly tail is attached at the back, holds a white teddy bear in her right arm and holds the dinosaur boy', "'", 's hand with her left, her back to the viewer. A pink skirt peeks from underneath her coat. The words "WAIT FOR ME!" are scribbled next to her head.',
    "\n",
    'All three of these children wear shoes or boots colored to match their coats. The chain of children swerves from the bottom right to the left and curves back to the right, past Lane, following another pre-teen girl wearing a yellow jacket covered in black dots that also has a cheetah tail hanging from the back of it. This girl', "'", 's back faces the viewer, showing that her hood is down underneath her straight brown hair. The hood has round ears attached to it. She wears blue jeans and brown boots as she runs down the right side of the sidewalk, making a bee-line for another little boy running away further down the sidewalk. Words scribbled above the cheetah girl', "'", 's head read "GET BACK HERE!".',
    "\n",
    'The boy running away wears all gray and his back also faces the viewer as he runs. Two large ears are attached on either side of his hooded head and a short tail hangs from the back of his jacket. The words scribbled above his head read "HEHEHEE!".',

    'Panel 3.',

    'In a close-up shot of Errie from her right side, part of a wolf mural looms in the background on the brown brick wall behind her. The black wolf enveloped in a yellow glow has his head lowered and positioned on the left side of the panel, baring its white teeth. Errie appears on the right side of the panel, grasping the straps of her pink backpack and her smiling, oblivious face is fully visible to the viewer as she looks ahead, revealing that she doesn',"'",'t see the mural as she walks past it.',
