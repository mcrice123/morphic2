    "1. [New view angle further down the street, showing Errie and Lane approaching an All Day Pancakes food truck. Some costume-clad people talk to the driver of the food truck and a vendor sells animal-themed hats and masks across the street.]\n",
    "2. [Lane dodges to the side as a small army of children nearly collide with them. The leader, a girl in a cheetah jacket ('Get BACK here!'), in hot pursuit of an elephant-clad child ('HEHEHEE!'), and another girl in a killer whale coat bring up the rear, clasping the hand of a small green dinosaur boy wearing rain boots ('Come on!'), who with his other hand pulls an even smaller piglet girl ('Wait for me!') along after him.]\n",
    "3. [Distracted by the commotion, Errie walks past a mural without noticing it. The head of a black wolf surrounded by glowing yellow swirls of paint comes into view as she passes it.]",
