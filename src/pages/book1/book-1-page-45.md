    'A close-up view of a young boy with long bangs and wearing a striped shirt shows him holding a soccer ball in his hands. He stands on the right side of the panel, peering in alarm at something off-screen to his left. Behind him, the grassy ground and thick trunks of tall trees provide the backdrop. A soft rustling sound can be heard ("fsshhshhSSSHHH"), gradually growing louder.',

    'A zoomed-out shot of the boy in the striped shirt from his left side shows him dropping the ball as he stares, dumbfounded, in the direction of the viewer.

    'Lane and Errie now appear on the left side of the panel against a backdrop of grassy ground and the trees bordering the clearing. Lane bends down to one knee on the grass, with one arm supporting her balance. Errie sits cross-legged to her right, leaning forward and holding her right fist to her mouth thoughtfully.',
