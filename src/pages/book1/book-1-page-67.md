    'A pair of hands type at a thin laptop sitting on a table in an angle shot. On the screen appears a web page with a title that appears to read "BUBBLE" above a search input and a two by 4 table of blocks. In the foreground, a mechanical pencil lies on top of lined notebook paper.',

    '"...Over large quantities of ash..." continues the speaker, who now appears as a woman holding a blue microphone up in front of her. She wears a light blue top with a reddish belt and her straight blond hair stops before reaching her shoulders. The woman appears under bright lighting on the right side of the panel against a backdrop of dark green. Masses of black particles swirl around her and a few rest on her head and shoulders.',

    'Errie appears on the right side of the panel, looking at something off-screen further right as she turns toward the viewer with her left hand on an armrest. She wears a pink t-shirt and sits in a chair in front of a table where the laptop sits with a mechanical pencil to the left to it on top of a spiral notebook. A small purple object rests to the left of the notebook. To the right of the laptop (which is also the background), a lit candle burns in a jar next to a closed book. Behind the laptop sits a metal tea set. A white outlet in the middle of the mustard-colored wall appears one foot above the table.',

    'Panel 4.',
    "\n",
    'The voice continues speaking from a flat screen TV on the wall, saying, "...Ash Root sheriff, Charles Rudigor, assures the public there is no need for alarm...',
    "\n",
    'Errie stands on the right side of the panel in an angled shot from below eye-level, as she faces away from the viewer and towards the left side of the panel, where the TV hangs on the wall. A doorway can be seen to the right of the TV. Errie',"'",'s red pajama pants also come into view.',
    "\n\n",

    'Panel 5.',
    "\n",
    '"...Sheriff, where did this ash come from?" asks the woman, who appears on the right side of the panel. She holds out her blue microphone to Sheriff Rudigor, who stands on the left side of the panel adjusting his sunglasses.',

    'A close-up on Errie',"'",'s face shows her astonishment and confusion as she blurts out, "WHAT."',
    "\n",
    'A crinkling noise ("--SKSH--") can be heard just before and after another off-screen voice says, "Green grasshopper to red ladybug! Over!"',
