    'The panel takes up the entire page. It features an overhead, close-up view of a black-and-white newspaper sitting on a wooden table under lamp light.

    'Only about an inch away, an eggshell-colored mug of coffee sits on a green ceramic coaster, appearing on the top third of the page.

    'To the right of the photo, a headline reads, "UNEARTHING MYSTERIES OF FOUNDER',"'",'S MINE".

I removed the page after this one, since it's not really helpful to the plot. 
I included the original [page 73][1] in the small section following the end of Book 1.
