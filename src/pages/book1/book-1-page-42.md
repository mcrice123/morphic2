    "\n",
    '"BAD NEWS!" shouts Lane with her hands raised to either side of her mouth, her right hand still holding her limegreen smart phone. She is visible from the knees up at the bottom of the panel. "Sheriff knows about EVERYTHING--but he thinks it',"'",'s all a PRANK!"',
    "\n\n",

    'Panel 2.',

    'An off-screen voice shouts, "WHAT?! But YOU didn',"'",'t tell him?"',

    'The white goat with the blond bangs and the green gem on his chest appears from the shoulders up, turning to his left with a confused look on his face as he peers in front of him suspiciously. The tree branches sticking up from his back are also visible.',

    'Another voice from off-screen replies, "YEAH! He',"'",'s gotten calls ALL DAY about this guy! ',"'",'Sounded like he',"'",'d been out here and didn',"'",'t FIND him!"',

    'Panel 3.',
    "\n",
    '"So when I called--" starts an off-screen voice, with emphasis on "I".',
    "\n",
    '"NO..." mutters Errie with a worried look. In a close-up on her face, she appears on the right side of the panel, peering to the left.',
    "\n\n",

    'Panel 4.',
    "\n",
    '"He thought I was in on it!" shouts the silhouette in the foreground with emphasis on the "I". She walks across the clearing from the left, towards two far-off silhouettes watching her approach--one tall one and one short one.',
    "\n",
    '"OH NO!" exclaims the taller silhouette, standing in the middle of the panel. "But--those OTHER calls...?"',
    "\n\n",

    'Panel 5.',

    'In a view of the white goat',"'",'s left side profile from the shoulders up, two layers of limegreen glow appear around him accompanied by a rushing sound ("SSHSHHSHHH").',

    'Panel 6.',
    "\n",
    'The rushing sound dies down and the limegreen glow starts to fade, but instead of the white goat, the blond young man now appears with the tree branches sticking out of his back behind him. He still has the same white horns on his head and wears the same white loose-fitting shirt. He peers in front of him with a disinterested expression on his face.',
    "\n\n",

    'Panel 7.',
    "\n",
    '"WOAH," says Lane, now standing shoulder to shoulder with Errie on the left half of the panel, her friend taking up the other half. The dark-haired girl looks down in front of her with astonishment,her eyes wide open. "That is UNREAL...I mean, it IS real. But wow..."',
    "\n",
    'Errie just gives her a sideways glance.',
