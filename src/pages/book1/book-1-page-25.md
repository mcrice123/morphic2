    '"What if it',"'",'s DANGEROUS?" asks Errie. She appears on the left side of the panel, running after Lane. Both girls face the right side of the panel and have their left fists raised as they run. Nothing can be seen behind them except pitch black.',

    '"We have our PHONES!" shouts the girl in the green hoodie.',
    "\n",
    '"LANE--!" the red-haired girl starts to reply.',

    'Panel 2.',
    "\n",
    'A zoomed out view of a green grassy hill next to a creek shows the two teenagers running across the grass from the woods near the right side of the panel. The bank on the other side of the creek is also grassy and narrow. More leafy woods provide the backdrop of the panel beyond the green grass and the creek. The creek itself curves from the bottom left of the panel to the center of the panel, disappearing from view a little to the right.',
    "\n",
    'Straight ahead of Lane stands a worn out wooden bridge, which extends from the green hilly bank and to the left, off of the panel. Black cylindrical pillars support the wooden structure and two railings line both sides of the platform. Both the railings and platform consist of simple wooden beams.',
    "\n",
    'Errie ducks slightly as she emerges from the trees on the right ("WOOSH, WOOSH"), close behind Lane.',
    "\n\n",

    'Panel 3.',
    "\n",
    'Lane pants as Errie stands to her right, also panting and hunched over with her hands on her knees. Her arms are partially obscured by her cardboard wings.',

    '"...OK," says Lane. "I was worried someone FELL off the bridge."',

    'Panel 4.',
    "\n",
    'A close up of the wooden bridge shows a beam missing on the right rail. Only this rail is visible, as most of the bridge is cut off by the panel border. The platform covers the bottom left corner of the panel, its right edge extending from the left center to the bottom center. A lone beam stands slightly to the right in the foreground, in contrast to the other vertical beams standing straight and connected to each other by a single row of horizontal beams. The row ends on the vertical beam closest to the one in the foreground and the end of the horizontal beam appears jagged.',

    'A voice offscreen says, "That',"'",'s how my BROTHER broke his ARM last week."',
    "\n\n",

    'Panel 5.', 
    "\n",
    'A gray bicycle, half-submerged in rushing water, leans against a black cylindrical pillar towering out of the creek. A grassy hill and a short drop-off provides the backdrop about a foot behind the black pillar and bicycle. The pillar spans from the center of the panel to the top right corner.',
    "\n", 
    'The clear blue water in the bottom half of the panel glistens in the sunlight and a wooden beam with a jagged end sticks out of the creek near the bottom border.',
    "\n",
    'A voice offscreen says, "I just HAD to check here FIRST!"',
