    'Visible from the shoulders, up, a black wolf enveloped in a yellow glow raises his nose towards the moon in the top right corner of the panel. He sniffs the air, his yellow eyes reflecting some of the moonlight that cascades over his face and back. A yellow, diamond-shaped gem graces his chest and he emits a soft rushing sound ("SHHSSHSHH").',

    '"Huh?" says Lane, turning away from the viewer to look at the window in the background. She sits cross-legged with her back against her bed and holding an open book in her hands. The cover is mint-green. "What was that?" she asks out loud to herself.',

    'Panel 6.',
    "\n",
    'A close-up on the violet glow shows the violet glow growing in size and a familiar wavy pattern appears inside it, similar to the pattern inside a blue door, but converging in a horizontal line running down the middle. The rushing sound grows louder ("SHSHSHSHSH").',
