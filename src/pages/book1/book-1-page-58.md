    'The two teenage girls stand at the left side of the panel, facing the golden retriever on the right side of the panel. Lane stands closer to the panel border, leaning slightly to the left as she watches the two characters in front of her. Errie stands in a defensive fighting stance with her left foot in front, her knees bent, and her left arm raised. The dog pulls back in surprise. All three characters stand in a grassy area with large fir trees providing the backdrop.',
