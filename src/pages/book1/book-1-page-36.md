In full view, except for his partially-visible horns at the top of the panel, he sits among long blades of green and yellow grass, dotted with white fluffy dandelions. He continues to glow limegreen from the shoulders down, including the vines still branched out on the grass and trees behind him. He rests his elbows on his crossed legs and holds his loosely-clenched hands in front of him.',
