For anyone who's curious about the _original_ second page of the webcomic...
_Or the following six pages that were removed from Book 1._ 

**That's right, when you click 'Next', the next page is page 9, NOT PAGE 3!** 
I decided not to update the names of the succeeding pages, so...sorry for any confusion. 

You can click the links below to see the old pages now OR...you can keep reading through Book 1. 
I moved the posts for the original pages to a small section following Book 1, so you'll run into them again as you keep reading.

[Original page 2 (2019)][1]

[Removed page 3 (2019)][2]

[Removed page 4 (2019)][3]

[Removed page 5 (2019)][4]

[Removed page 6 (2019)][5]

[Removed page 7 (2019)][6]

[Removed page 8 (2019)][7]
