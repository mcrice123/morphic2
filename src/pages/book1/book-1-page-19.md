    'Panel 1.',
    "\n",
    'A voice from offscreen yells, "HEY!"',
    "\n",
    'A pair of feet in purple-black tennis shoes stop abruptly in a zoomed-in shot close to the asphalt. Situated on the right side of the panel, the toes of the shoes point to the right and shoe laces swing on the right shoe as the blue skinny-jean-covered leg pauses in midair.',
    "\n\n",

    'Panel 2.',
    "\n",
    'The brown brick building takes up the entire top-left quarter of the panel in a zoomed-out shot showing Errie standing in the street and turning to her right to look back at Lane, who stands on the sidewalk corner and points behind her with her thumbs in the direction opposite that of her friend. A large mural on the brown brick wall is clearly visible--the full figure of the black wolf enveloped in yellow, the head of which was seen in the previous page, looms obstinately in the middle, scattering three small black human-shaped figures to the right and left and partially covering the large white text painted above, which reads "NO MORE WAR". The word "war" is emphasized with black paint underneath the white.',
    "\n",
    'Beyond the street in the background, running adjacent to the one on which the mural is displayed, runs another sidewalk, but green lawn and trees grow in place of buildings.',
    "\n",
    'Lane says, "We',"'",'re going to my house first!"',
    "\n",
    '"Oh--OK!" replies Errie.',

    'Panel 3.',
    "\n",
    'In a panel without a left border, the two teenagers walk to the right side of the panel, along a sidewalk running in front of another mural on the other side of the brown brick building. The mural consists of two lines of text and symbols that read as follows:',
    "\n", 
    '"i [heart]',
    "\n",
    'ASHROOT"',
    "\n",
    'The "i" character is painted white, the heart shape is pink, and "ASHROOT" is green.',
    "\n",
    'Lane leads the way as Errie turns to watch a group of young girls run pass them in the opposite direction, enveloped in white background. The girls sing a chant in unison, saying the following:',
    "\n",
    '"We',"'",'re the best and the greatest, YEAH YEAH!',
    "\n",
    'We',"'",'re the best and the greatest, YEAH YEAH!',
    "\n",

    'We',"'",'re the best and the greatest, YEAH YEAH!"',
    "\n",
    'Lane mutters, with a smile, "Kids..."',
    "\n",
    'All five of the girls wear softball uniforms, belonging to the same team. They have orange pants and stockings, yellow shirts, and cleats. The girl in the lead wears a ball cap and a ponytail, carries a glove in her left hand, and tosses up a softball with her right. The second girl lands on the asphalt with her hands behind her to keep her balance. Her long pigtails fly up and she holds a glove in her right hand. The third girl follows close behind her, leaping off of the sidewalk corner with her arms raised above her and the long braid under her cap flying behind her. Finally, the fourth and fifth girls complete the set. The fourth girl holds a glove in her right hand and a bat in her left. The fifth girl also holds a bat in her right hand. Both girls have ponytails, but the latter wears a ball cap backwards on top of hers.',

    'Panel 4.',
    "\n", 
    'In a zoomed-out view of a gray house with a shingled roof and a cracked concrete driveway, Lane stands with the screen door and red front door open, holding Errie',"'",'s pink backpack with her right hand by the top strap. Errie stands on the concrete walkway leading up to the front step from the driveway. She still wears the red jacket and the cardboard wings on her arms.',
    "\n",
    'Lane says, "I',"'",'ll put our stuff inside. Sorry, the house is a wreck!"',
    "\n",
    '"That',"'",'s OK!" replies Errie, facing Lane while her back is to the viewer. "I',"'",'ll just wait out here."',
    "\n",
    'The driveway meets the right half of the house where two square windows look out at the street. The other end of the driveway stops at the street running diagonally in the bottom left of the panel. Running parallel to the street, an old sidewalk crosses the driveway and stops on the top left quadrant of the panel, a few yards away from the trees visible at the top. No grass can be seen beyond the trees, marking a clear separation between the yard and the woods. The lawn in the yard grows a bit tall, as though needing to be mowed. Blades of grass also emerge from the cracks of the driveway and sidewalk.',
