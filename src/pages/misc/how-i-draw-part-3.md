# How I Make a Page

Welcome to Part 3 of my drawing process!
We are now at the third of four posts dedicated to showing
how I create the pages of “Morphic”. **Don’t forget to check
out page 26!** Just click the left arrow icon to go back a
page and see it.

## Part 3: Text Stage

Here’s where the drawing process starts to get techy. I use
a program called GIMP for adding text and color layers to
my pages. It’s like Photoshop except it’s open source and
managed by a community of developers. You can download it
free of charge [here](https://www.gimp.org/).

### Step 1: Open the file

I begin by starting GIMP and opening my scanned image.

### Step 2: Create Layers

My image is automatically opens as its own layer. I add two
more layers--one filled with white and one that stays
transparent. I put the white layer below all other layers
and the transparent one on top, sandwiching the scanned
image in the middle.

### Step 3: Single out lines

Here is my goal--I want to keep the lines visible, but be
able to see through the white spaces between them. There
are different ways of accomplishing this, but basically
what I do is select the whole area that’s black on the
image layer (only lines are selected, no white-space),
select the transparent layer, and fill the selection with
black.

Then I hide the image layer, but the lines are still there.
If I hide the top/transparent layer, the lines disappear
and only white shows up. If I show that layer again and
hide the white layer, only the lines show up.

### Step 4: Crop Images

I create two new files that are copies of the original
layers file. Then I use a cropping tool to cut out the
parts I want---the first page on the first file and the
second page on the second file.

### Step 5: Add Text

On each image file, I add editable text layers using the
‘Text’ tool and move them around. The typefaces I use are a
mix of my own custom-made fonts (using a free
typeface-generation website) and open-source fonts
available from Google. I mostly use one I had generated
based on my own handwriting.

### Step 6: Draw Speech Bubbles

I use a variety of selection tools and path tools to shape
the areas that become speech bubbles. After filling the
areas with white, I stroke with the paintbrush tool.
Sometimes I even do more than one bubbles layer, to get a
layering effect.  

### ‘Edit->Undo’ is my friend
Sometimes order matters in the way I create speech bubbles
or anything else, so I frequently test changes and undo
those I don’t like. _Who doesn’t…?_
