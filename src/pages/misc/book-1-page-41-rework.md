# A Necessary Change

Maybe I mentioned this before, but when I drew Capri as a goat for the first time in the story I drew him with a necklace, but then afterwards changed my mind. 
**I was originally going to draw _all_ morphics with their unique stones on necklaces, which they would wear around their neck.** 

Although the rationale isn't revealed yet for _why_ morphics have these stones on their chest, I'm ok with sharing the reason for the design change, since it isn't _really_ significant to the plot. 

I want to suggest the _permanence_ of these stones---**that is, they can't be easily taken from their bearers.**
Therefore, it's pretty silly to continue drawing these stones as necklaces, which imply the opposite. 

Hence, the change. And it was an easy one too.

### Lighting and Shading

So I mentioned in the last post that the lighting and shading on this page is the look I'm hoping to pursue on all my pages. 
_Maybe_ you can't tell, but **notice the sharpness of the lights and darks**. 
I want to keep that sharpness as much as possible, instead of blurring _all_ those edges across the page. 
It conveys more confidence in my lighting/shading **and it looks cool!**

I'm still learning how to improve my lighting/shading technique as I go along, so I might go back and touch up this page a bit. **However, I like the overall look to it!**

### Progress on pages 33 and 34 of Book 2

I finished inking this week! 
And I began flatting them---**I am on track for uploading the finished page 33 in 2 weeks and page 34 the week after that.**

It's been a _weird_ start to the year, having these two pages started but not finished for so long. 
**I am excited not only to get them done (finally), but also to share how they're turning out!** 
I think the hard work I put into them really shows.

# Thanks for reading!

**Check out the fully-colored [page 41](https://mcrice123.github.io/morphic/blog/book-1-page-41/)!**

Next week, I'll post the _last_ reworked page I have in my buffer.

**That's right---We're almost there, folks!**

**20 pages** in Book 1 redone and uploaded this year! _Isn't that crazy?_

I'll talk more about it next week.

**_Have a great weekend!_**
