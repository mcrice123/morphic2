# Another week, another reworked page! 

Only one thing to say about this page---Capri looks **a lot more surprised** without his mouth gaping open! 

No other news except that I'm still making progress on sketching the plot of Book 2. I think it's coming along pretty well, and I'm slowly growing more confident in the story line. 

I did slow my pace on Book 1 production so that I can focus on other things, **so next week's page will be another reworked page!** 

### Thanks for reading! 

**Here's a [link](https://mcrice123.github.io/morphic/blog/book-1-page-33/) to the reworked page!** 

Have a great weekend!
