# YUS.

I really like how this page turned out! I'm super proud of the newly-inked Wolf and the colors.

### Color Balance

**This is the first page I tried out the color balance tool to adjust the colors.** Basically, I fill 
in the areas with the true colors, but then adjust them so that they look more like they would 
at a sunrise. **I'm really happy with the results.** 

Now I'll have to go back to page 5 to adjust the colors accordingly...

### Redrawing Wolf 

I _had_ to redo panel 3. I found a good reference to use and redrew Wolf. 
**And oh my _goodness_ this panel is so _good_!!!** I put a lot of thought into it 
and shrunk the guy down so that he's looking _up_ at the leaping Wolf. **I always intended 
this panel to be comical, but the eye contact between the characters is _perfect_!** 
Redoing the guy's expression also helped make the panel. 

### Adding glow around Wolf

The original page didn't have any glows around Wolf, but I decided to add it in panel 3 for emphasis.
Therefore, I added the glow around Wolf in the other panels for consistency. 

### Thanks for reading!

Remember to check out [page 6](https://mcrice123.github.io/morphic/blog/book-1-page-06/) of Book 1! 
I'll upload another updated page next week, **so have a great weekend!**
