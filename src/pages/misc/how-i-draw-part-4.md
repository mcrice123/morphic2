# How I Make a Page

Welcome to Part 4 of my drawing process!
We are now at the final post dedicated to showing how I
create the pages of “Morphic”. Don’t forget to check out
page 27! Just click the link to go back a page to see it.

## Part 4: Color Stage

Last week, I talked about using GIMP to turn my pages from
image files to layered lines and text. This week I’m talking
about my coloring process and creating the final image.

### Step 1: Open file and apply settings

I set the image mode from ‘Greyscale’ to ‘RGB’. An image
set to the former will not show color, even when you paint
with a selected color.

### Step 2: Flatting

Here’s where my process seems a little counter-intuitive.
I color the areas of the page with "wrong" colors before
filling them in with their true colors.

**Why?**

* It’s easier to go back and change the color of something,
like Vix’s coat. If I realize I used the wrong shade of red,
I can select Vix’s coat in all panels of the page by using
the ‘Select By Color’ tool and fill in all areas with the
correct color.
  * Note: While it is true I could select by color with the
  true colors, if something other than Vix’s coat is the
  same red, those areas will be selected too. Selection is
  simpler when these areas are distinguished and this
  distinguishment is possible by flatting these areas in
  different colors on a different layer.
* I hear that flatting leads to more efficient coloring time.
Basically I’m filling in the areas to select before even
deciding what color these areas are going to be.
* I really like the flatting process. It’s like coloring a
coloring book without caring about the color combination.
It’s very refreshing.

So...I create a layer underneath the lines layer and fill
in areas one color at a time, unselecting those areas by
color so that I don’t paint over them accidentally.

### Part 3: Add True Colors

Here’s the easy part of the coloring process. Now that I
have my flats layer, I only have to Select By Color on that
layer and fill in all those areas on another layer (under
the lines layer) with the true color. I don’t like creating
a lot of unnecessary layers, so I would typically create
two, one for foreground and one for background.

In order to use the same colors I used before on previous
pages, I open up the necessary files and use the ‘Color
Picker’ tool to select the true color and fill in the areas
on the current file with that color.

At this point, I add whatever colors I want. I often use
gradients (color blends) for the backgrounds.

### Part 4: Shading/Brights

**LAST STEP!** This step is a little longer than it looks…
First I create two layers, one for shading and one for
highlights. Then I add a layer mask to each.

**But what’s a layer mask?** It’s like another layer, but it
controls the transparency of the visible layer it’s
attached to. I use it mostly to add gradient effects in
the shading/brights.

I currently use a shade of blue-green for shading and pure
white for highlights. I paint with these colors directly
on the layers and adjust their transparency on the layer’s
corresponding mask to make them semi-transparent so that
the true colors below them to show up a little, giving
the illusion of depth.

### Step 5: Just kidding, this is really the last step…

Oh yeah! We need to export this thing. Right now the file
is still not an image file you can upload to the internet.
It is still a .xcf file, which is only displayable in GIMP.
I have to export it to .jpg format.

So ‘File->Export as…’, use default settings, and _WHA-LA!_
The image appears in the specified folder!

...And all these substeps take me about 2 hours on average.

## Thanks for reading!

I hope you enjoyed this little run-through of how I make
pages. Feel free to try out [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/)!
It’s helpful for me and
I recommend it for basic image-layer editing. You could
draw from scratch on it if you wanted to. I've tried it,
but I personally find that I draw way better traditionally
than by computer, so I only use it for simple things like
outlines, speech bubbles, text, and select-and-fill style
coloring.

Other possible software you could use for digital drawing
include, but are not limited to:

*  Adobe Photoshop
*  Clip Studio/Manga Studio
*  Krita

Alright, I’ll get off my soapbox now.

**HAPPY BIRTHDAY MORPHIC!**

I’m done celebrating now. Thanks again for reading and
have a great weekend!
