That's one wishlist item checked off my list: Lane jamming
out to tunes on her headphones.

# Good news!

I started drawing pages for Book 2.

I would have liked to finish writing Book 3 before drawing,
but I decided to take the plunge and come back to it. What's
nice about graphic novels is that I can go back and forth
between writing and drawing when I need to.

As of writing this post, I completed the flatting stage for
pages 1 and 2 of Book 1 and started the actual coloring and
shading. So far I'm pleased with the results. I'm trying not
to get to picky about the shading, because it's easy for me to
get hung up on it. I should be finished with both pages before
Monday.

**...Which also means I'll have pages to upload starting next
week!**

I'm super excited to share Book 2 with you! Hold on to your
hats---**the first page features a new Morphic character!**
Check it out on next week's update!
