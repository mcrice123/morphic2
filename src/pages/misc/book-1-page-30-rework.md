# _Splash!_

This page was a **doozy!** I spent a long time just on the water. 

I'm still not thrilled with how the splash looks, but it looks better than it did. **I'll just leave it and if it still bothers me in a year or so, I'll keep working on it. For now, IT'S FINE.** 

...Same goes for a lot of these pages.

### Rework Plan continued

Quick update on where I'm at:

* I have **32** pages reworked and colored (not all uploaded)
* I have **42** pages left to color (two of them call for rework)

So out of 74 pages in Book 1, I'm **43%** of the way done--- _**almost half-way!**_

Considering that most of the finished pages needed the most work, **I'm optimistic about getting the rest of the pages done in less time...** but I still hold reservations about whether I'll stay motivated to keep going with Book 1 pages before transitioning back into Book 2. Of course, the only way I'll know is by trying. 

**Short-term goal: get enough pages done for _3_ more weekly updates!** I can't remember how many pages I have ready to upload, but it's enough to cover all but 3 weeks before June (my break month). 

And when I say 3 weekly updates, I don't just mean single page updates... **some weeks I'll upload _multiple_ pages!** Like _last_ week.

**I'm only doing that b/c I'm so far ahead on these reworked pages.** It doesn't make sense to feature a before-and-after comparison of color-only pages, as the changes won't be as drastic. In addition, these color-only pages should proceed fast enough to upload them in batches. 

After that, I'll take my month-long break and I'll decide how to proceed with my update schedule when I return. 

# Thanks for reading!

Don't forget to check out [page 30](https://mcrice123.github.io/morphic/blog/book-1-page-30/), fully-colored. And come back next week to see another reworked page! 

**Have a great weekend!**
