## A pause to remember 9/11

I only knew that something was wrong because my family turned on the news before school, which we never did. All I could comprehend, at the time, was that a big building crashed to the ground unexpectantly. I waited for assurance that the building was empty...but the news just kept playing back footage of the event. Soon enough, I realized the bitter truth. 

It has been 20 years and I still hear new stories of the people lost that day. How different the world would be now, if they were still here.

## Porco Rosso

_Who says pigs can't fly?_

Perhaps this pig pun is used in this month's selected movie, but that's not really the line that inspired it. Apparently, it's "men are pigs". Don't judge it too rashly, there's only one pig in this movie and he, the bounty hunter, becomes the hunted target of the air pirates and the Fascists.

Also, pig puns abound.

**Another Studio Ghibli all-ages classic directed by Hayao Mizaki!** It's not the most popular of his movies, but it's got a nice charm to it! It takes place in Italy and there are some cool scenic shots with the red plane. Fun humor too--the pirates at the end of the movie are **hilarious**! I need to watch this again...

### Errie as Fio

More red hair! There are a lot of red-headed females in Miyazaki's films, so expect Errie or Vix to cosplay more of his characters. I think Errie's determination matches that of Fio.

### Wolf as Porco

Had to bribe him with fruit punch and a beach chair, but Wolf agreed to dressing up as the protagonist. Both like taking naps and wearing cool shades.
