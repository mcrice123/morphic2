# How I Make a Page

Welcome to Part 2 of my drawing process!

We are now at the second of four posts dedicated to
showing how I create the pages of “Morphic”. But don’t
worry--page 25 is also posted! Just click the left
navigation button to see it.

## Part 2: Ink Stage

Out of all four stages, this one is definitely the
shortest. It often takes me under an hour to ink one page.

### Step 1: Prep

I begin by taping the pencil drawing onto a flat surface,
which is usually a table or clipboard. Then I tape a sheet
of tracing paper over it.

### Step 2: Inking

I draw with several sizes of black ink pen, but I typically
use size 005 for the main content of each page. The tracing
paper is thin enough for me to see the pencil lines through
it as I draw.

I’ve also gotten into the practice of drawing with my hand
on another sheet of paper on top of the tracing paper,
shifting it around as I draw. This is so that I don’t get
oil from my hands on the tracing paper because I noticed
early on that my inked lines didn’t look so great and they
looked far better when I started drawing with minimal skin
contact on the tracing paper. I’m guessing that the oil on
my hands was repelling the ink as it was drying and it
affected the quality of the lines.

### Step 3: Scanning

After finishing the drawing, I untape both the ink drawing
and the pencil drawing. I place the ink drawing in the
scanner and align the edges. Then I run the scanner with black and white
settings so that the image only contains straight black and
white pixels.

Now I have an image saved on my laptop!
