She wears a white dueling disk, complete with the card platform for placing cards, on her black-vein-covered left arm and holds a hand of red-backed cards in her left hand.

From now on, I think I will limit the number of characters portrayed on these cosplay pieces. Three seems to keep it fun.

## "Yugioh!" (the "original" series, not those other spin-offs)

I watched _way_ more of "Yugioh" than "X-Men" growing up. I didn't watch all of it, but I stuck with it for a long time. I recently watched the end of the series and it did not disappoint! 

I highly recommend this anime show for teens. Kids may be ok, but it gets intense--human possession gets used as a plot point over and over again.

**_What is "Yugioh" about?_** _A boy and his close friends travel to a Dueling Monsters competition on a remote island. Assisted by the phantom pharoah trapped within his Millenium puzzle, he sets out to win the competition, defeat the bad guy who trapped his grandfather's soul, and free his grandfather and everyone else from the shadow realm!_

### Lily, dressed up as the Pharoah

Other than the crazy hair, our favorite tiger morphic nails the Pharoah's look! 

### Wolf, as Seto Kaiba

He looks good, but he doesn't have his cards together. Kaiba would not be pleased. 

> "You're a third-rate duelist with a fourth-rate deck." --_Seto Kaiba_

### Errie, as Serenity Wheeler

Although Serenity is not part of the main cast, Errie easily cozies up to her role as the adorable blind girl who undeniably pulls the audience's heartstrings.
