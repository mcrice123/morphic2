# SPEECH BUBBLES

Changes on this page mostly consist of reformatting the characters' dialogue! A _few_ changes 
were made to what was said, but none were of great consequence. They were a result of trying to 
make the conversation and speech bubbles make better sense. 

Speaking of, I learned a lot about how to make clearer speech bubbles from a resource that one 
of my brothers shared with me. It has a lot of great tips in it about creating dialogue in comics, 
many of which about issues I did not foresee. You can find this helpful resource [here](http://www.blambot.com/articles_tips.shtml).

I don't have much more to say about this page. The only other change on this page (aside from coloring) 
was redrawing Chan's hand. 

The main reason I decided to work on this before the majority of pages was b/c the dialogue needed to look
right..._and there is a **lot** of dialogue on this page._ So it got a high rework rating. 

**However, the _next_ updated page has more lineart reworked on it, so the post for it next week will be a 
lot more interesting!**

### Thanks for reading!

Here's a link to [page 14 of Book 1](https://mcrice123.github.io/morphic/blog/book-1-page-14/)!

Come back next week to see the next updated page. Have a great weekend!
