# I'm satisfied with this page.

Awesome colors! I'm really happy with how well the backgrounds in the different panels complement each other.

Like a _lot_ of pages in this scene, the rework on the inks involved fixing how I drew Capri. **Although I deliberately made him a dislikable character, it's bad when multiple panels of the character makes me grimace.** I think I should have practiced drawing him a lot more before he appeared in the comic. 

**Fortunately, I only had to fix one panel on this page!** (Capri's curls looked a _little_ too perfect to take him seriously...)

Anyway, here's the link to the fully-colored [page 35](https://mcrice123.github.io/morphic/blog/book-1-page-35/)!

### Thanks for reading!

Next week I'll share another reworked page, as usual! **Have a great weekend!**
