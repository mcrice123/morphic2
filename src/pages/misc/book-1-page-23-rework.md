# Welcome back!

**[Page 23](https://mcrice123.github.io/morphic/blog/book-1-page-23/) of Book 1 is updated!** The 
fourth panel is featured above. 

I didn't have to redraw much on this page. **The most change is probably the facial expressions** in 
the second and fourth panels. Just redoing those was a vast improvement for the whole page. 

I also adjusted the drawing of Errie in the second panel. I literally just panned it downwards to make 
more space in the panel. It was just...too _similar_ to the fourth panel. I was thinking of redrawing it, 
but I didn't think the drawing was too bad. Sometimes just looking at it and figuring out why it bothers 
you helps with solving the problem. 

I am finding this rework process _very_ calming and therapeutic. I'm looking forward to coloring more pages 
and sharing another one next week. 

### Thanks for reading!

Come back next week for another colored page! Have a great weekend!
