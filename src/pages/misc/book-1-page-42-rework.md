# That's all the reworked pages..._for now!_

Thanks for your patience as I took time to figure out my writer's/artist's block. 
It's been a weird experience for me to keep updating on a weekly basis without adding to the story line. 

**I hope you enjoyed reading my posts regarding changes to pages in Book 1!** 
I reworked all the pages that required the most notable changes aside from coloring, so from here on out it _should_ just be coloring that's left to do on the rest of Book 1. 

In other words, I probably won't be making weekly posts about them anymore. 
I'm pretty sure the text content for them would sound _too_ repetitive.

### Status on pages 33 and 34 of Book 2

I am in the middle of coloring both pages. 
**I anticipate having page 33 done in time to upload it as next week's post!**
I should only need to add lighting and shading to finish it.
**Then I will finish coloring page 34 and post that the following week.** 

### Year to date progress

Yes, page 42 of Book 1 marks the 20th page I got done this year! 
**I am almost half way to my goal of making/finishing 42(ish) pages by December.**
(42 is how many pages I produced and uploaded last year.)

_Heheh...I mentioned '42' in every sentence of that paragraph._ 

# Thanks for reading!

Don't forget to check out [page 42](https://mcrice123.github.io/morphic/blog/book-1-page-42/) in full color!

**Next week I'll break the cycle and post the long-awaited page 33 of Book 2!** 

_Get excited!_

And have a great weekend!
