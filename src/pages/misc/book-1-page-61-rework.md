# This was a fun page!

**I enjoyed painting the galaxy background in the reworked panel.**
It was also fun to redraw the portrayal of the characters in the same panel---The original silhouettes didn't appear clear enough. 

### I made some progress on Book 2 pages

Pages 33 and 34 are _still_ underway, but **I finished inking one and now I'm halfway inking the other.** 

My plan is to get these two pages done and upload them the two final weeks before I take my month-long break in June. 
**I think I can do it!** 

### Thanks for reading! 

Check out the fullly-colored [page 61](https://mcrice123.github.io/morphic/blog/book-1-page-61/)! 

Don't forget to come back next week---**the next reworked page I'll share has the lighting/shading style I'm thinking about using on _all_ the pages!** 

Have a great weekend!
