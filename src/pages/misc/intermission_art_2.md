# New Site Launched!

I'm really proud of myself for getting this site done!

* I uploaded _all_ the pages for Book 1, plus the latest art updates.
* You can navigate to any part of the plot easily!
  * 'Recent Posts' on the side bar shows latest content.
  * 'Blog' on the navigation menu displays posts from earliest to latest.
  * **Plus** I included navigation to previous/next posts at the top and bottom of each post!
* I even put up a page to view the existing characters' bios! Just click on 'Main Cast' in the navigation menu at the top.

### Please alert me about any bugs you might find

I did my best to weed through the site to find any
undesirable misspellings and what-not. There are a _few_
design flaws I noticed when viewing the site from a smaller
screen, but **I don't recommend viewing the pages from a
smartphone anyway, since the pages would be too hard to
read.**
I don't have the functionality to allow you to zoom in.

### Comments?

Although the template for this site comes with Disqus, I
disabled it temporarily in order to figure out how to get it
to work. I'm okay with launching without comments for now,
especially since most of my audience can still comment on
Facebook anyway. **Speaking of Facebook, check out the
[Morphic Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/MorphicGraphicNovel/)!**

**And while I'm at it, how about checking out my
[profile](https://github.com/mcrice123) on Github?**
Because I built this website with _rad coding skills_...
using a pre-made template called
[Future Imperfect](https://themes.gohugo.io/future-imperfect/)
running on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

# Thanks For Reading!

And thanks for visiting my new website! I've been looking
forward to this milestone since the year-and-a-half ago that
I started posting my pages publicly. I look forward to
sharing more of the story here!

I'll post the third intermission art update next week, along
with news on my progress with writing Book 2!

**Have a great week!**
