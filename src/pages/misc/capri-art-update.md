The main antagonist of Book 1. I've been looking forward to
drawing a portrait of Capri and his vines for some time.

# Extending Break By Two Weeks

I'm still in the process of rewriting the series. I got really
busy the past couple of weeks and I had enough time for
intermission art and launching a website (and cleaning up the
bugs following launch).

Not to worry though! That's an excuse enough for me to draw
more character portraits anyway. These portraits are a lot
easier than the comic pages, since the focus is on viewing
the character(s) from one angle instead of many. Plus, no
speech bubbles.

**Thanks for following** and come back next week to see who is
featured in the next character portrait!
