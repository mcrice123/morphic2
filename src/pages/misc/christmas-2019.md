I hope you had a Happy Thanksgiving! 

It's the moment you have been waiting for...

## Christmas Doodle! 

...Heheh. 

Ok, _moving on_ to what you were _really_ waiting for...

## I finalized 17 pages!

They're all in different sections of Book 1, so here are the links to each individual page that's updated as of this post. 
Check 'em out! 

* [Page 18][1]

* [Page 19][2]

* [Page 21][4]

* [Page 22][5]

* [Page 23][6]

* [Page 31][9]

* [Page 32][10]

* [Page 67][11]

* [Page 68][12]

* [Page 69][13]

* [Page 70][14]

* [Page 71][15]

* [Page 72][16]

* [Page 74][17]

And why did I choose these sections, you may ask? **B/c they're short.** 
For me, finishing pages is hard and I knew it would be even harder if I started out doing **one** big section. 
**I would feel more motivated** to work on the bigger sections if I had some short easy ones already checked off the list. 

That being said, I am now **almost a quarter of the way done with Book 1!** 

## Thanks for reading! 

I want to talk about my plans for the upcoming months, but I spent the whole day today getting the last few pages done and getting this post ready. 
**Page 32 significantly contributed to my delay in uploading this post, b/c it took me _way_ longer to finish than all the other pages---a whopping 11.75 hours.** 
It deserves its own shout-out for blowing the previous record-holding page out of the water (one that took 8 hours to finish). 

Sigh...I'm learning more and more how important it is to avoid water in comics. _My goodness._ 

**I really appreciate you reading my comic!** 
Please like/follow the ["Morphic" Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/MorphicGraphicNovel) if you haven't already. 
**I'll be back in January to continue the story!** 
I'm looking forward to another great year and _especially_ to sharing the next few pages.

Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays! See you in 2020!
