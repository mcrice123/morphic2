I hope you had a Happy Thanksgiving! 

It's the moment you have been waiting for...

## Christmas Doodle! 

...Heheh. 

Ok, _moving on_ to what you were _really_ waiting for...

## I finalized 17 pages!

They're all in different sections of Book 1, so here are the links to each individual page that's updated as of this post. 
Check 'em out!

And why did I choose these sections, you may ask? **B/c they're short.** 
For me, finishing pages is hard and I knew it would be even harder if I started out doing **one** big section. 
**I would feel more motivated** to work on the bigger sections if I had some short easy ones already checked off the list. 

That being said, I am now **almost a quarter of the way done with Book 1!** 

## Thanks for reading! 

I want to talk about my plans for the upcoming months, but I spent the whole day today getting the last few pages done and getting this post ready. 
**Page 32 significantly contributed to my delay in uploading this post, b/c it took me _way_ longer to finish than all the other pages---a whopping 11.75 hours.** 
It deserves its own shout-out for blowing the previous record-holding page out of the water (one that took 8 hours to finish). 

Sigh...I'm learning more and more how important it is to avoid water in comics. _My goodness._ 

**I really appreciate you reading my comic!** 
Please like/follow the ["Morphic" Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/MorphicGraphicNovel) if you haven't already. 
**I'll be back in January to continue the story!** 
I'm looking forward to another great year and _especially_ to sharing the next few pages.

Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays! See you in 2020!
