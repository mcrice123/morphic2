## Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe

I read the "Chronicles of Narnia" growing up and enjoyed them. I'm not fanatic about them like I am with Studio Ghibli. I enjoyed reading them for the first time, but then not so much on a second read. Perhaps it's a matter of taste.

However, I really enjoyed the 2000's movie adaptation of "The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe" and I highly recommend if you haven't watched it.

And since it's winter for half the movie and Father Christmas appears, I figured this makes for a good cosplay theme for December. 

### Capri as Mr. Tumnus

The goat horns are about all these two characters have in common. Mr. Tumnus is very kind to Lucy. Capri on the other hand is _not_ so with Errie. 

### Errie as Lucy

These two have a few traits in common. Both are protagonists, get into trouble, and are curious about the world around them. I even picture Lucy handing Errie some snow balls to throw at Capri for fun. 

### Tau as Aslan

I think these two characters' common traits go without saying. _Of course_, I'm going to pull Tau into a cosplay for Aslan! And I didn't want to draw a whole third character, so I settled with just his tail. It works. 

## Thanks for reading!
