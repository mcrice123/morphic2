# How I Make a Page

Have you ever wondered how digital art is made? Many
styles exist, as do many methods.
To celebrate two years of drawing “Morphic”, **I’m happy to
share a glimpse into my drawing process**. I have a lot to
say about each stage, so I’ll be dedicating four separate
posts to cover how I make a page, **one post for each stage**.
Regular page updates are still going and you can check them
out by pressing the back/forward icons or clicking a recent
post link.

## Part 1: Pencil Stage

I hand-draw all my pages before coloring them digitally.
Here is how I start!

### Step 1: Thumbnail

I draw my pages in two-page layouts. I start out with an
easy, messy sketch with scribbled scripts along the sides.

### Step 2: Photos

I collect photos to use for reference. I didn’t use them as
much at the beginning of Book 1, but now I rely on them a
lot.

### Step 3: Initial Sketching

I lightly sketch the panels and figures on regular 8.5” x
11” copy paper. I draw on copies of a template I made when
I first started Book 1, so that the dimensions of each page
is always the same.

### Step 4: Final Details

This is the longest, but very gratifying, part of the
pencil stage. It can take anywhere from one to two
hours…taking up most of the approximately 2 hours average
time I spend in the pencil stage for each single page of
“Morphic”! (approx. 4 hours for a two-page spread)

# Thanks for reading!

about the ink stage AND to see the next regular page update!
