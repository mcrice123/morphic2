Her white-tipped fox tail pokes out from under her coat, pointing behind her as she rests her hands on her hips. She looks down at Wolf to her left with a frown. She wears a red-and-green-striped scarf around her neck, a round red ball on her nose, and curvy antlers on a headband over her orange curly hair.',

He wears a string of colored lights wrapped around his neck and belly, with a single strand trailing behind him and disappearing behind the curtain. Two pink, black-veined tentacles stick out from behind the curtain above him, each holding an item. The top one holds a shiny red ball and the other holds a headband with antlers sticking out of it.',

### Now that I've joked about them, I guess those antlers are sticking around...

**But what can I say?** They make Christmas posts fun!

# Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!

I've been enjoying my break so far. I'm glad I decided to do only one post for the holidays. 
It's easy to stack up too many tasks for myself and be so focused on the amount of workload 
ahead of me. **Only needing to finish this one update made drawing it _very_ fun.**

I hope you like this goofy Christmas art! I'm very proud of the Catz. Especially Catius and his 
Chrismas lights...and Tenti's squid arms...

...Well, gosh. I could go on and _on._

### But you're probably wondering about the next update!

I made a deal with myself to **not** draw any pages until January. I want to enjoy this 
holiday season _as much as possible!_ 

However, I also want to announce what my upload schedule will be like this coming year and I 
still need time to think about it, so **I'll post a status update January 5th**. It won't be 
a _page_ update, but **it will contain information on when I will post the _first_ page update 
of the year**. 

That being said, I'll have...

[_checks calendar_]

...**three weeks** to enjoy myself and strategize a little bit on what I'll do next. 

I still have some writing to do..._and much staring at page-number stubs pinned to a bulletin board 
on my wall and drumming my fingers together in deep concentration._

Aaaaaaaand I should get back to my break.

# Thanks for reading!

I hope you have a wonderful holiday season! Don't forget to check for the next status update on January 5th. 
**Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!**
