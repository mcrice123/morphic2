_I've wanted to do this for so long..._

I always enjoy it when an artist I follow shares artwork of their own original characters "cosplaying" as characters from a well-known franchise. **Now it's _my_ turn!**

I'll be sticking to the theme of "cosplay" on my monthly posts this year, so look forward to some cool artwork!

_*I am posting this artwork as-is to keep my deadline, but I'll come back and update it is when it's finished._

## Marvel's "X-Men" and "X-Men: Evolution"

Funny enough, I never really had much exposure to actual comics from Marvel and DC growing up. But I _did_ watch the TV shows based on those comics. I was introduced to "X-Men: Evolution" first and later discovered "X-Men" when I was in high school. I binged on all the episodes on Netflix and when that was done, I caught up on "Evolution" as well. 

**I enjoyed both shows!** I consider them a huge influencer on my story development. Unlike many hero stories, the shows didn't focus solely on a single protagonist's journey, but rather on the journey of many characters with different backgrounds and abilities, working together to face a common foe. 

_Alright, now for the line-up..._

### Wolf...NOT dressed up as Magneto

As revealed at the very end of Book 2, Wolf has the ability to exert a magnetic pull, which obviously gives him something in common with the archenemy, Magneto. However, since he doesn't want to dress up as the bad guy in this pic, he's content with just tossing around the iconic helmet. 

### Errie, dressed up as Jean Gray ("X-Men: Evolution")

I think this goes without saying... Errie has red hair and so does Jean. Also, this outfit looks good on both. 

### Vix, as Jean Gray ("X-Men")

Yes, I decided to have two Jean Grays. That's what I get for having so many redheads who would look good in her costume from either show. Also, Vix has telepathy, so she has that in common with Jean.

### Lane, as Jubilee ("X-Men")

Man, the color scheme of this costume still hurts my eyes, but Lane pulls it off really well!

### Chan, as Cyclops ("X-Men")

Chan seems like a "Cyclops" kind of kid. He also seems like the kind of kid who would prefer the old version to the new version, so...yellow and blue spandex it is!

### Lily, as Rogue ("X-Men: Evolution")

Lily has the phasing ability that Shadowcat has, but she has more of a "Rogue" personality. Plus, Rogue can just take Shadowcat's phasing ability and use it herself, so _technically_ she can phase through walls like Lily...
