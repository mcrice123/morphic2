For the past three months I featured Studio Ghibli films, so here's something a little different! 

## Naruto: Shippuden

I only got introduced to this anime TV show this year and its quality really surprised me! The animation is excellent!

There are apparently two anime TV shows based on the original manga: "Naruto" and "Naruto: Shippuden". I haven't watched all of the episodes, but each episode includes flashbacks of prior scenes, so it doesn't feel like I'm left out for not watching everything up to that point. Also, the intro/conclusion music is top-notch! (It has its own playlist on Spotify.)

The plot of the anime revolves around an orphan boy named Naruto who is treated like an outcast and wants nothing more than to become hokage (the strongest ninja in the land) so that everyone finally respects him. But as he trains to become a ninja, he gets pushed to his limits, even to the point of unleashing the evil creature trapped inside of him--the dreaded nine-tailed fox. 

As with most anime out there, "Naruto" and "Naruto: Shippuden" are not without their quirks, so I recommend them cautiously. You only need to look out for two major ones. One, Naruto likes to catch people off guard by turning into an unclothed girl (that seems to taper off pretty quickly though). And two, he eventually trains under a highly-respected sage who likes to "hangs out" with women to "gather research" for his romance novels. You have been warned.

### Chan as Naruto

Aside from the obvious fox theme...there isn't much in common between these two. 

But hey! Who _wouldn't_ want to be a ninja?!
