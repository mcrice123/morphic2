# I Guess I Can Draw Goats Now

**I am _so_ happy that I fixed Capri's goat face in this page.** 
I didn't use _any_ references to draw him! 
**As a result, he looked less like a goat and more like a..._dog_?** 

_[Realizes an eerie resemblance to a former family pet.]_

### Well anyway...

**Here's a short update from behind-the-scenes.** 
It had been many weeks since making any serious progress on Book 1 pages, **but _this week_ I finished _one page!_**

So now there's one new page in my buffer and I need content for _two more posts_ before my established June break. 

Since I seem to have lost interest in coloring Book 1 pages now, I'm considering other possible content to post for those last two weeks of activity. 
**I'm still not sure about having any Book 2 pages done before then, so those posts might contain new artwork instead.** 

I favor the latter a lot more right now, b/c it would be a fresh outlet for creativity _and_ it might help me regain enthusiasm to continue either Book 1 coloring or new pages in Book 2 after my break. 
**In addition, creating new art will give me the opportunity to try out some new drawing or coloring techniques, which is always fun to try!**

### Thanks for reading!

**Here's the link to [page 38](https://mcrice123.github.io/morphic/blog/book-1-page-38/)!** 
Check it out in full color!

I'll post another reworked page next week! **It has some _cool effects!_**

Have a great weekend!
