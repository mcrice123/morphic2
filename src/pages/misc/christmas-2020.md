Light radiates from the top left of the artwork and cascades over the show-dusted roof, which leaves the front-facing wall of the house and the bushes below it in shadow.

_The best face._

I think from now on, I'll do image embeds of my favorite character expressions. Why hadn't I thought of this sooner...?

## The tradition continues...

As in years prior, I have included [almost the same] antlers and red nose in this year's Christmas art! I hope you enjoy the humor...these Morphics tend to _not_ want to wear them, though last year's artwork was a pleasant exception. 

**I decided to do this piece completely in Clip Studio!** (Check it out here [on their website](https://www.clipstudio.net/en/).) No hand-drawing, no GIMP. I really like how it turned out and it was a good learning experience for me. **I am strongly considering creating Book 3 pages with this program, since it could help streamline the page-making process.** Plus, it has a large community following and cool easy-to-download assets (lots of freebie ones too---I used one such brush for those string lights).

And based on the resulting appearance of this artwork, I don't think there will be too much trouble keeping the page styles consistent. :)

## What a year!

This time last year, I never would have guessed half the stuff that came to happen these past twelve months. I count myself lucky... 

Far as I know, I never got COVID. That's good.

My heart goes out to everyone who's suffering from it or whose family suffers from it. I also feel bad for people struggling financially right now because of the pandemic.

**I suppose there's not a lot I can do to help the situation, but just know that you're in my prayers.** If you're facing a lonely Christmas this year, you won't be alone in spirit.

Ok, heavy dialogue aside...

## Let's talk about _Morphic_

### How many comic pages did I get done...?

**22** new pages in Book 2! And...

**26** FINISHED pages in Book 1 (including updated text).

**= 48** total. _(Nice!)_

_I also updated text on the first 35 pages of Book 1, so those ones are "**completely** done"..._

### What's planned for next year?

**1. Complete all of Book 1.** I have 25 pages left to finalize and then I need to update the text on the last stretch of pages that are already finalized. I expect to complete this goal by June!

**2. Finish new pages for Book 2.** You should see the remainder of Book 2 by the same deadline as #1. I guess I'll be ending Book 1 housekeeping in time to start the housekeeping for Book 2!

**3. Start finalizing Book 2 pages.** Because they sure need it...the first half of them, that is. I am only planning to finalize pages up to pages 33/34, since the ones after those look decent (and hopefully not _too_ inconsistent).

**4. ...Start Book 3!** You should see the first pages in July. _It will be the beginning of the end..._

### Any other notable accomplishments this year?

Um. Yes.

* There's this _shiny new website_ you're looking at... I built it myself and it looks great!

* I started learning how to draw comics in Clip Studio. It's pretty neat!

* When I'm not working on _Morphic_, I have other story ideas I draw in sketchbooks. I have several sketchbooks going so far!

## One FINAL Note 

I updated a previous post in which I discussed why Wordpress wasn't a good option for me. I learned recently that I had a pretty big misconception about the CMS and **it turns out that there _is_ a good option for developers to learn how it works and build their own for free**. I took out my long rant on the price plans and explained why I was mistaken. If you're interested, [here is a link to that post](https://www.morphicwebcomic.com/book2/book-2-page-60/).

## THANK YOU for reading!

Now to wrap up a _really_ long post! It's good to reflect on the extensive progress I've made this year and look forward to continuing the journey next year. 

That being said, I wish you all a very Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, and a Happy New Year! I'll be thinking of you.

**If you haven’t already, please like the [“Morphic” Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/MorphicGraphicNovel/) and [subscribe to my mailing list](http://eepurl.com/g8TzPb)** to get news and updates on progress towards the crowdfund campaign for printing _Morphic_!

I'll be back the first Saturday of January with the next page in Book 2! Stay healthy and safe. God bless.
