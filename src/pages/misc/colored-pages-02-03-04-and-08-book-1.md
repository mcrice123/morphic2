**Settlers-scene all done!**

I decided to get all the pages in this scene out of the way. This scene only ranges from 2 through 8 (seven pages). **I feel less cringy about these "flashback" pages now that they're colored _and_ the text boxes look cleaner.**

The featured images above are the parts of the pages I like the most, but I sense, as I look back over the pages, that I'll be coming back to touch up the coloring. No doubt the pages look better with color, but I see parts that could use a little polish. I _was_ rushing a little when I did these. **Pretty backgrounds require a bit of patience, you know?**

# Behind the scenes update

Alright, so I said I would post colored Book 1 pages until the first post in March and then announce further news about what I'm doing behind the scenes. So here's the update...

### About Book 2...

**I'm experiencing some writer's block.** I haven't gotten much further with the current pages that are in progress (35 and 36). It's clear from my work on all these Book 1 pages (some of which required redrawing some areas) that **it's not a problem of wanting to draw at all.**  

Upon further reflection, it dawned on me that my primary motivation for drawing all these pages was my excitement for an upcoming scene in the story. **So if I can reignite my excitement for the ending of Book 2, I'll be able to finish these current pages and continue the story!**

So why am I _not_ excited right now?! Good question. 

I think I'm just dreading having to make final decisions about the plot. I like to create lots of loose ends and I get anxious about tying them up just right. 

I never experienced this kind of writer's block for Book 1 and it didn't dawn on me until recently why that is. **With Book 1, I drew out ALL the possible scenes in sequential order.** I ended up drawing thumbnails for... _130 pages?_ This was before I shortened the storyline to 74 pages, but it helped me figure out how I wanted the story to go. I could visualize all the scenes I wanted and how/why they came about. 

**With Book 2, I skipped drawing out the whole story line, b/c I was already sure of how it would start.** I just wanted to dive in and figure out the rest of the plot as I went along. Now that I'm approaching the last scene I'm more certain about, I feel anxious about the "gray areas" coming up that I need to decide on and when I get anxious, I tend to freeze up. 

**SO THERE. I need to draw out the scenes of Book 2.** I actually started doing that and it's going very well! My goal is to get to the end of Book 2 with a more detailed idea of the sequence of events. Then some scene that I draw roughly will get me _really_ excited to continue drawing pages!

### In the meantime

I'm going to keep coloring Book 1 pages! I already have a third of the pages done (maybe not uploaded yet) and I don't feel the momentum going away. **I'll just plan on continuing posting colored pages through the end of May, after which I'll take a month-long break.** I'll keep figuring out the story of Book 2 and hope that I can continue the story after that break. 

### Thanks for reading!

Check out pages [2](https://mcrice123.github.io/morphic/blog/book-1-page-02/), [3](https://mcrice123.github.io/morphic/blog/book-1-page-03/), [4](https://mcrice123.github.io/morphic/blog/book-1-page-04/), and [8](https://mcrice123.github.io/morphic/blog/book-1-page-08/)! Next week will just be a single page, but a lot has changed on it. 

Have a great weekend!
