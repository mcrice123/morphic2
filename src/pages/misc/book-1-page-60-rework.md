# WOOOOOOOOOO

**I'm happy to finally experiment with coloring the inside of a blue door!**

I might come back to this page when I figure out a style I like, but I'm glad to have some portrayal of what it looks like when someone goes into a blue door. 

### Still Writing Book 2's plotline

**I think I'm making great progress!** 
I've been able to figure out how a lot of the plot points lead into each other.

I _think_ I drew enough panels at this point such that Book 2 will turn out to be longer than Book 1. 
**BUT OH WELL.**
I think it will be _worth it!_

### Making some progress on pages 33 and 34 of Book 2

I decided to give in and just experiment working on these pages via GIMP. 
**I figured out last week how to draw lines with changing size as I'm drawing on my Wacom tablet!** 
This breakthrough opens up the possibility of inking my pages digitally, _so why **not** try it out?_

Plus, I think I'll have an easier time figuring out the layout of page 34 if I do it digitally.
**It's _page 34_ that's been giving me the hardest time to go forward with Book 2!** 
It's like the first page of a scene that I hardly gave much thought to---_visually_---and that scene is necessary to the plot, but there's so much _action_ in it that I don't want to mess it up!

Anyhow, **as much as I like drawing traditionally and keeping my skills sharp,** I see a need to evolve my drawing process at this point. 
**I actually feel pretty excited about doing more drawing digitally!** 
I might flip back and forth between traditional and digital for the lineart, but I'll do my best to keep the style consistent, at least throughout Book 2. 

### Thanks for reading!

**Check out the fully-colored [page 60](https://mcrice123.github.io/morphic/blog/book-1-page-60/)!** 
Next week I'll post another reworked page! 

Have a happy Easter and a great weekend!
