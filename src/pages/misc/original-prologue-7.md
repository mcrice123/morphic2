In the background, the other three men lie sprawled on the ground, turning in alarm to look in the same direction as the blond man at something off-screen and to the right. On the far left sits the settler with the black shirt, holding his arm. His gun and hat lie on either side of him. A yard to his left, the native lies with his belly to the grass as he looks over his left shoulder. Just to his right, the man in the yellow shirt crawls back, away from his opponent. The sky above them grows even lighter.',
