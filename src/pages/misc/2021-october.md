A circlet graces her dark hair, large circular white earrings dangle from her ears, and red triangle markings brand her cheeks and forehead. She smiles as her yellow eyes peer straight at the viewer. Black veins cover all visible skin and her striped tiger tail curls up behind her.',

Despite being left to last minute, this fanart cosplay turned out pretty good.

The fandom for Hayao Miyazaki films continues...

## Princess Mononoke 

_This_ movie is disputed to be _the_ best of the Studio Ghibli collection. It won the Japan Academy Prize for Best Picture--the _first_ animated film to do so! It was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. 

The plot follows Prince Ashitaka after he saves his village from an attack from a demon, who touches him and leaves on him a deadly curse. He leaves his village in order to find a way to remove the curse, seeking help in distant lands where the gods of the land still roam. There, he discovers mounting conflict between the people of a prosperous mining town and the gods of the land. Among the animals fighting for their forest, Ashitaka meets a girl referred to by the townspeople as "Princess Mononoke" or "the savage princess". 

I should mention--this is an adult-rated movie, _not_ a kids' movie. It's got blood, decapitation, and _super scary demons_. Keep in mind that this movie is set in old Japan and their concept of gods and demons is different from that of the West. The demons in this film are what animal gods turn into when they die a terrible death... And they are _frightening._ 

Many aspects of this film have impressed me over the years...perhaps it's the various character subplots woven into the movie. Perhaps the best way for me to describe what this movie means to me is to share one scene that still gives me the chills. It depicts the titular character standing on the roof before starting her epic one-on-one battle with Lady Eboshi. 

But words aren't enough to describe it, so here's a shot of that scene from the movie (keeping in mind that the wind is blowing).

This is a good place to tie up my review, so I'll leave off with that. **I highly recommend this movie.** It's terrifying, but it is also awe-provoking.
