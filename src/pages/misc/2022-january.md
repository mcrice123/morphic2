## Happy New Year!

I wanted to give an update about the comic, but it has to wait until next month at the earliest, so today is just the regular artwork post. Hopefully I can share more information in February!

## Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind

_Yes!_ Another Studio Ghibli film. And a good one too!

In a futuristic, war-torn world slowly taken over by the toxic jungle, a princess strives to save her small kingdom from mounting dangers that could in turn lead to the long-prophesied end of all human kind.

The only caution I ought to give for this movie is for violence, but it’s not near as bad as Princess Mononoke. In fact, according to [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087544/parentalguide?ref_=tt_stry_pg), it’s rated PG in the US. While war is a backdrop for the story, many factors help lighten the mood, including fun characters, humor, a fox squirrel, and, above all, a charming princess flying around on her own personal glider and making us wish that we had one too!

### Errie as Nausicaa

Aside from the obvious shared trait of having naturally red hair, these two protagonists care a lot about other people and they also share a similar motivation of saving their homes from a grave calamity.

I hope you like the fox squirrel plush that I included in the drawing. Also, did you notice the glider in this picture?

## Thanks for reading!
