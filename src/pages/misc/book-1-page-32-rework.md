Not a very interesting reworked page today, **so how about some discussion?** 

You're probably wondering **how I'm choosing the order of pages to color**, so today I'll talk about that. 

# Gameplan: The First Sweep

Perhaps I mentioned before, but **I'm first hitting all the pages that clearly need ink rework.** Since a high concentration of these pages are in the first half of the book, this means that the first half will look more 'done' than the second half. _I'm sure that will look confusing, but oh well..._

**However** ...this also means that, **(1) as I get better at coloring with every page, I'll look back at the pages I colored and want to change them.** I'm already seeing it now, as I'm figuring out a better way of applying lighting and shading that builds off of the techniques I've been using. 

In addition **(2) I may discover an inconsistency b/w consecutive pages.** If I color a page, move on to other pages, and then come back to the one directly before or after it, it's likely that I'll notice a difference that shouldn't be there. For instance, I noticed that a page I was coloring had glowing in it, but the previous page (which I colored earlier) did not when it logically should. 

So these first colored pages will be _done_ on inking, but still need fixes on coloring _and_ any perceived inconsistencies. **I call this the _"first sweep"_.**

The purpose of the first sweep is to make all pages of Book 1 look good on the ink level and at the same time lay down the groundwork for coloring. **This sweep only focuses on the pages that need the most work, but I'm almost done with these pages and I'm already starting on pages belonging to the _second sweep_.** 

# Gameplan: The Second Sweep

In contrast to the first, the main goals of the second sweep are:

1. Color all pages with finalized style of base colors, lighting, and shading.
2. Maintain consistent shading, lighting, and base colors for pages with same characters in same settings.
3. Final check on good inking and text bubbles (including font changes). 

Since consistency if super important in finalizing the pages, **the best stategy to avoid overlooking inconsistencies is to work on these pages in batches.** 

In addition, I want to focus on getting most of the uncolored pages done first, while still reworking existing colors as I go along. **Therefore, since the second half of the book is mostly uncolored, I'm going to work on pages in sections starting from the end.** 

And the **pages are categorized into "sections" or "batches"** based on compared scenery, **so that I can use the same or similar lighting and shading across all the pages in a given batch.** 

# Thanks for reading! 

Next week I'll post another reworked page, **but don't forget to check out [page 32](https://mcrice123.github.io/morphic/blog/book-1-page-32/)!**

Have a great weekend!
