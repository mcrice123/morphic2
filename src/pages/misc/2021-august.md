A few weeks back, I had such a strong craving for the music in "Kiki's Delivery Service", that I listened to the soundtrack on repeat for days! 
I'm over that now, but for me, that music will **never** get old.

## Kiki's Delivery Service

I grew up _loving_ Studio Ghibli movies! I still need to watch some of the newer ones that came out in the past ten years, but I have a box set of the classics. **And "Kiki's Delivery Service" is one of my favorites!**

_This is an all-ages movie about a 13-year-old witch who, as part of witches' custom, leaves home for the first time to live on her own in a city by the sea. She flies on her broomstick and she brings along her familiar, a black cat named Gigi._

This movie is **one of the most popular of the Studio Ghibli movies**! And (almost) all of their movies are really good, so that's saying something!

It's directed by none other than Hayao Miyazaki and its beautiful music produced by Joe Hisaishi. 

_I highly recommend!_

Alright, now for the line-up...

### Lane as Kiki

In addition to sporting short haircuts, these two girls enjoy listening to music--Lane on her headphones and Kiki on her portable radio. Also, Kiki's outfit looks good on Lane.

### Chan as Tombo

Chan likes to build remote-control cars. Tombo likes to build human-propelled aircraft. I can see those two spending _hours_ together, fussing over a cool project in some basement...

### Errie as Ursula

What can I say? Both gals make good supporting characters. Errie may be the protagonist in "Morphic", but as Lane's best friend, she has a history of playing along with her schemes.
