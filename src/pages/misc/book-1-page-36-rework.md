# A Fun Experiment 

**I am glad to be coloring Book 1 pages for many reasons.** One of those reasons consists of an excuse to practice shading and lighting. 

I've colored enough pages of Book 1 to figure out that my style needs to change in regards to lighting and shading. I started experimenting in some of these pages I uploaded recently, including this one. **Here I stuck to using one color each for shading and light (and almost the same transparency across each layer), but allowing myself to 'smudge' or blend the colors on each layer.** 

### No blending?

**In contrast to the hard-edged shading/lighting I typically use, the shading/light on this page looks _closer_ to what I want my pages to look.** _However_, I heard a tip from another artist sometime after coloring this page, saying that **it's easy to tell beginning artists from professionals because the former do a lot more unnecessary blending in their coloring.** In other words, it's generally _better_ to stick to hard-edged coloring with as little blending as possible. Too _much_ blending and it looks overdone. 

Since then I figured out a compromise. I'll still color without blending, **_but_ I'll start experimenting with layer modes, different colors, and multiple areas of different transparencies on the shading/lighting layers.** 

This will add more flexibility to distinguishing the state of different objects. For instance, **I'll be able to shade Errie and Lane in such a way that it's more obvious when their clothes are wet.** It's always bugged me that, after the page in which they stepped out of the pond, it just wasn't obvious that they were _soaked_. **Lighting and shading will certainly remedy that problem, which makes it super important that I get the technique right!**

### Thanks for reading!

Check out [page 36](https://mcrice123.github.io/morphic/blog/book-1-page-36/) in full color! 

I really appreciate you following my journey as I figure out the best way to proceed with my graphic novel series. I don't have much progress to report right now, either in Book 1 or 2, **but I still have a buffer of a few pages left!** 

That said, I'll post another reworked page next week! I'll give more details on what's going on behind the scenes in that post. 

Have a great weekend!
