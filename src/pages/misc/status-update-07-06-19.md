# Welcome back! 

I hope you had a happy 4th of July!

As promised prior to my month-long break, I shall update you on how things are going from my end.

### Where I'm at now

This week, I _finished_ the pencil stage for **pages 35, 36, and 37** and _started_ the pencil stage for **page 38**. I have also finished flatting **4 pages from Book 1**. 

As you can probably guess, I won't have a page ready for posting next week---or for the rest of the month.

Here's a boiled-down explanation of why (if you want a shorter read, skip to the summary).

### Experimenting with Book 2

I'm changing up how I make pages. Before, I worked on 2 pages at a time. Now I'm increasing that to **4** pages at a time. 

This is an experiment. Focusing on more pages at a time might help with preventing inconsistencies in the story. 

And the process might be easier on my brain, since I'll be focusing on these pages while they're all on the same stage and not flipping from one stage after the other in short spurts. I'm exercising different brain processes for each drawing stage, so it might help to not switch back and forth so often. 

### Continuing the rework of Book 1

**I still feel driven to work on Book 1** so that's what I'm going to do! 

Of course, this means dividing up my drawing time between this and Book 2, so I had to come up with a plan. 
After thinking a lot about it over my break, I decided to cut the time in half between the two. 

Here's what I'm hoping to accomplish each month:

* Focus on pages in the same drawing stage in Book 1 (like this month I'm flatting the pages that need flatting). I'll alternate what stage to work on each month. 
* Start and finish 4 pages of Book 2. 

At this pace, I expect to have **half** of the work done by December, of what's left to finish Book 1. I'll probably only upload 20 of the finalized pages before then, but then from January to May I'll wrap up and upload the rest---about 50 pages! 

### Summary

I'm on my first batch of pages, which won't get done until the end of this month, so I'll be ready to post the **next page update on the first weekend of August**. So August 3rd. 

In addition, **since I want to keep up a reliable upload schedule for Book 2 pages, I am decreasing the frequency of the updates to _once every two weeks_.** 

And I know that's pain-stakingly slow and I wanted to avoid that for a long time. However, I have to make a compromise in order to do all the things I want to do and do them well: continue the story for Book 2, keep reworking Book 1, and share something I've finished on a regular basis. 

I only intend to go at this pace for a year. By that time, I calculate I'll be done with reworking _all_ of Book 1! **And _then_ I can begin the process of _printing it!_**

And I'll have more drawing time to devote to Book 2.

# Thanks for reading!

I'll be back on August 3rd with a new page! If you haven't liked the "Morphic" Facebook page yet, [please do so!](https://www.facebook.com/MorphicGraphicNovel/)
