    'The man in the black shirt appears alarmed and angry in a close-up view of him in the center of the panel. Visible from the shoulders, up, he wears a brown cowboy hat on his brown hair and a limegreen handkerchief around his neck, knotted at his throat.',
    "\n",
    'Another word box on the right side of the panel reads, "THE SETTLERS PROTEST, but the native claims to be the protector of this land..."',

    'Panel 2.',
    "\n",
    'A word box at the top left corner of the panel reads, "...And THREATENS TO KILL THEM HIMSELF if they do not comply."',
    "\n",
    'A close-up shot on the native, visible from the chest, up, shows that he also wears a string of teeth around his neck. He faces slightly to the left, toward the word box.',

    'A word box at the top left of the panel reads, "The settlers get ready to shoot him..."',
    "\n",
    'The blond man with the white shirt appears in the center of the panel, at an angle from the ground. He faces slightly to the right as he pulls out his pistol from the leather holster hanging at his right side, over his black trousers. He points it and it emits an audible "CLICK".',

    'Panel 4.',
    "\n",
    'A word box at the top right of the panel reads, "...But the native MYSTERIOUSLY disappears."',
    "\n",
    'In the background, the distant figure of the native sprints along the bank toward the left side of the panel, grinning. In the middle ground, the settler in the black shirt turns around so that he now faces the viewer. His green trousers are clearly visible now.',
    "\n",
    'In the foreground stand the man in the yellow shirt on the left side of the panel and the man in the white shirt on the right side of the panel. The man on the left together with the man in the middle ground glare at the man on the right. A white circle with arrows extending from it and pointing at both settlers reads, "Guns left in camp". The man on the right returns a sheepish grin as he cradles the barrel of his pistol in his left hand. Another circle with an arrow pointing at the gun reads, "Not loaded." The words "Heh heh..." appear near his mouth.',
