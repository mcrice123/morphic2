    'Text at the top left corner of the panel reads, "The settlers who founded our town of Ash Root came over a hundred years ago."',

    'Three men on horseback ride from the right side of the panel, to the left, across a flat plain. The men wear cowboy hats and sit on saddles strapped with bags and parcels.',

    'A word box at the top left corner of the panel reads, "When they saw this land, the three of them saw much promise, for the men came looking for gold."',

    'A close-up on one of the settlers shows his comrades a few yards away in the background, their horses standing idle. The man in the foreground appears on the right side of the panel and holds up the brim of his hat with his right hand as he gazes ahead, in the direction of the viewer. He wears a buttoned shirt, a vest on top of that, and a handkerchief tied tightly around his neck. The panel cuts him off below the waist.',
    "\n",
    'The settlers behind him also gaze forward, still on their horses. Centered horizontally in the panel, the closer one faces the viewer as his horse lowers its head. The other one appears slightly to the left and holds his reins back as his horse faces the left side of the panel. Both men wear suspenders, but the one further away has longer hair and a handkerchief clearly visible around his neck. More detail on their saddles shows that they both have saddle blankets underneath and water cantinas hanging from the side.',

    'The word box at the top left reads, "They set up camp next to the river and panned for gold for several days."',
    "\n",
    'A view of the landscape reveals the figures of the three men performing various tasks at their campsite. In the foreground, one of them kneels at the edge of the river, which runs across the bottom right corner of the panel, and sifts water in a round bowl. He appears at the bottom of the panel, centered horizontally, and a bumpy ridge starts just behind him and runs to the right side of panel, parallel to the running stream. Four large trees grow off of this ridge, three close together on top of it and the fourth standing at its base. Two of the horses appear behind ridge, their reins tied to one of the trees.',
    "\n",
    'A dozen yards beyond the ridge, three pop-up tents stand in a curved line in the center of the panel. Their closed openings face the burning campfire, around which the two other men',"'",'s figures appear hard at work. One kneels to the right of the fire and holds a rifle as if to clean it and the other one appears to the left of the campfire, walking toward the viewer and to the right as he holds the reins of the third horse following him.',
