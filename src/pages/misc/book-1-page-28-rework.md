# Happy Vines

Ode to Bob Ross:

_This week's reworked page features a variety of happy vines...a short, stumpy vine here...a long, slender vine there...a beautiful scenery_ filled _with happy vines._

This week's updated page is [page 28 (Book 1)](https://mcrice123.github.io/morphic/blog/book-1-page-28/)!

### What changed on page 28

**I think drawing all the vines in Book 1 had to be the most challenging part of the whole book.** Part of it 
is b/c they're so elaborate and I spend a lot of time on them, **but also the fact that they had to be 
_glowing_ most of the time** and I _draw_ all the glows in ink first...It got a _little_ over-the-top on some 
pages.

That said, I'm definitely happy that the reworking of the inks on this page **didn't need any changes 
on the vines**. I only modified Errie's surprised expression on panel 2 and **(the most dramatic change)** 
I painstakingly **erased** all the sound effects that where initially drawn in and recreated them digitally.
**So all those 'HHH's you see...they were in _every_ panel on both page 27 and 28. I erased _all_ of them.**

I just wasn't digging those hand-drawn words and how rough they looked. I _had_ to get rid of them. **So
I did.**

_Therefore,_ in addition to uploading the new images for page 28, **I also uploaded the updated image of page 
27** so that both are consistent on how the sound effects are displayed. 

There are still other pages that have the hard-drawn sound effects, so I'll have to update those too when I 
get to them. Ironically, I didn't add _any_ 'HHH's on the following page (29)...so _that_ will be easy to
update.

### General Assessment

**This comic page is one of my more _exciting_ comic pages (before AND after coloring)** and it's 
one of the first action scenes in Book 1 (probably #2, after the settlers' flashback). Since I didn't 
have to redo much of the inking on it either, I think it was also one of the strongest inked pages I've 
made. The different character positions and angles I chose for all the panels did a good job of portraying 
the back-and-forth movement of the character in flight defending herself from the pursuing vines. **I am 
especially proud of this action scene b/c it gives a further glimpse into Errie's character---her quick 
response to a threat shows a rare display of resilience and boldness in this soft-spoken teenager.** 

In fact, I think one of the reasons it was so well drawn was b/c I actually created a reference to draw 
from. **I recorded myself doing the exact swinging motion Errie is doing in the above featured panel** and 
watched the video over and over to get the position just right. It wasn't a great recording, so no individual 
frame seemed suitable for what I wanted, but I got what I needed from the combined series of motions and 
**_WHA-LA_! I made a panel that I'm _still_ proud of!**

# Thanks for reading!

I was on a roll this week coloring more pages! **Next week will feature a page that _definitely_ needed 
TLC on the _inking_ side.** Thanks again for checking out what's new on "Morphic" and have a great 
weekend!
