    'Against a plain white background, six figures help decorate two Christmas trees, one on either side of the artwork. Both trees have presents underneath and are decorated with ball-shaped ornaments. Large text at the top of the artwork reads, "Merry Christmas!" The large text continues on the bottom of the artwork, saying, "...and Happy Holidays!"',
    "\n",
    'On the far left, Errie jumps back in alarm ("AAH!") from a smiling black wolf emerging from the branches as he sits at the base of the decorated tree. Her hair and her jacket, the only items on her that are colored, are the same shade of bright red. Behind her, she drops an ornament which hits the ground with a rattle.',
    "\n",
    'On the opposite side of this same tree, Lane reaches up toward the top of it in an attempt to place a star ornament there, but she comes up a foot short and lets out a groan ("UGH"). Only her green sweatshirt is colored.',
    "\n",
    'In the middle of the artwork sits Capri. Vines come out of his back behind him and extend on either side of him in the background. With the vines themselves not colored in but surrounded by a limegreen glow that matches the color of Capri',"'",'s pants, they stand out from the uncolored Christmas trees. One of the vines behind him rings a bell ("DING-A-LING") as a frown covers the young man',"'",'s face. He has a round, bright red ball attached to his nose (the same shade as Errie',"'",'s hair and jacket) and he wears floppy antlers on his head. He leans back on his arms as he sits with his feet loosely easing out of his usual crossed-legged position. A few storage boxes used for the ornaments sit near his feet, open and emptied.',
    "\n",
    'To his right stands Canissandro, next to the Christmas tree on the right. His dog tail, the sleeves of his baseball tee, and his hair pulled back in a short ponytail are all colored yellow. He holds a star ornament in his hand and looks up at the top of the tree, which is taller than the other one. He mutters in surprise, "OH..." Behind him, one of the glowing vines reaches up and places a star ornament at the very top. Another vine holds up a ball-shaped ornament just below the first vine, as though deciding where to place it. A third vine places a ball-shaped ornament a little lower on the right side of the tree.',
    "\n",
    'Finally, on the other side of the tree on the right, Sirena perches on top of a carry-on suitcase lying on the ground. Her fluffy squirrel tail towers above her as she shakes a wrapped present in her hands ("RATTLE RATTLE"). Only her utility uniform is colored a bright shade of light blue. The author',"'",'s initials are visible underneath the suitcase, reading, "Maria Rice MCR 12/22/17"',
