# Wolf!

I'm very happy with this redone page! I was originally just going to fill in the existing line work digitally, but I didn't feel too sure with the result, so I redrew Wolf. It looks _SO_ much better!

### The following changes were made to page 7:

1. Redrew panel 1 (kept the same glow lines).
2. Colored whole page.
3. Redrew text boxes and updated text box fonts.
4. Updated sound effect in panel 3.

### Thanks for reading!

Check out the new page 7 [here](https://mcrice123.github.io/morphic/blog/book-1-page-07/)! **Next week, I look forward to doing something a little different than the usual,** so don't forget to come back and check out next week's post! 

Have a great weekend!
