# Back to the chase!

**The only part of this page that needed fixing was the very last panel.** I had no problem with how I drew Errie tripping over a tree stump, but the lines in her jeans coincided with the lines in the panel above. 

One of the tips I learned from an artist I follow online is that **it's best to avoid what he called "tangent lines" between panels, so that the lines don't stop a person's eyes from moving around the page.** Sure enough, the more I looked at this page, the more my eyes stopped at that intersection above this panel. **So I endeavored to modify it.**

### But one thing leads to another...

I did my best to work with the existing linework and save the panel. **_But alas!_** Nothing I tried sat right with me, so I resorted to redrawing the whole panel. 

To avoid finicking too long on the details, I opted for a silhouette in this panel. Now, after coloring the page, I have no regrets. **It looks awesome!**

I've fixed tangent lines before, but never with a complete redrawing. **It usually only takes small modification**, but so much is happening on this page that proved challenging in all my attempts to fix the issue. 

_Oh well..._

Check out all of page 29 [here](https://mcrice123.github.io/morphic/blog/book-1-page-29/)!

### Thanks for reading! 

Next week, I'll feature one of the first ten pages of Book 1!

**_Get excited!_** And have a great weekend!
