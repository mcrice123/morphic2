    'Panel 1.',
    "\n",
    'A word box at the top left of the panel reads "Suddenly, a native man appears on the opposite shore."',
    "\n",
    'Visible on the left side of the panel from the waist down, a red-robed figure with yellow hide-covered feet stands in the foreground. Sparse gray-colored rocks lay scattered across the ground around the figure and the river runs across the panel just yards beyond. Further in the background, the alarmed settler, who was panning the water with the bowl, drops the item from his hands and it splashes into the water. More detail on the settler reveals that he wears a black vest and button shirt, gray pants, and brown boots and hat. He kneels on one knee as he jerks back in fright at the sight of the character in the foreground.',
    "\n",
    'The ridge behind the settler hides the campsite and the trees appear at the right side of the panel, hiding the horses. However, one settler in the distance looks over the ridge, appearing between the new character and the first settler within the panel. An exclamation point appears above his head.',
    "\n",
    'The top of a word box stretching from the bottom right of the panel to the top right of the next panel, reads, "The settlers reach for their guns and warn him not to attack them."',
    "\n\n",

    'Panel 2.',
    "\n",
    'The bottom of the previous word box reads, "The man, however, demands the settlers not to degrade this land, for the natives regard it as sacred."',
    "\n",
    'On the left half of the panel, a native man',"'", 's face appears zoomed in, such that his chin is cut off by the bottom panel border. His bald head sports a red mohawk hairstyle with an orange feather sticking out and he wears red makeup over his eyes and the bridge of his nose. Red feathers dangle from gold earrings on his earlobes. His frowning black eyes gaze forward, but not at the viewer. Behind him lies a great expanse of yellow and green plains.',
    "\n",
    'Another word box expands from the bottom right of the panel to the top right of the next panel. The top of it reads, "He explains that his people purposely set aside this land because anyone who dwells here gets visits from ancient creatures in his sleep,..."',
    "\n\n",

    'Panel 3.',
    "\n",
    '"The bottom of the word box started in the previous panel reads, "A SURE SIGN THAT THE SPIRITS DESIRE THIS LAND FOR THEIR OWN."',
    "\n",
    'In a view of the river from behind the ridge, the other two setters appear in the foreground, with their backs to the viewer as they peer at the scene. The one on the right side of the panel  wears a white shirt under his suspenders, a red handkerchief around his neck, and a black hat over his blond hair. The other settler appears near the bottom left corner of the panel, wearing a brown hat over his black hair, a narrow red handkerchief around his neck, and a yellow shirt under his suspenders. The trees appear on the left side of the panel now and the settler near the river now stands at the edge of the water, centered horizontally within the panel between the two figures in the foreground in a determined stance.',
    "\n",
    'The red-robed figure still stands on the opposite bank. His robe only covers the right half of his body and a cord around his waist holds the fabric in place. His left side reveals his bare torso and the breechcloth he wears under the red robe.',
