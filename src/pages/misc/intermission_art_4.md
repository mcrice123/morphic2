# It's a Wolf

Will you look at that---It's *COLOR!*

Usually I wouldn't have time to complete the coloring for
a picture, but I got this portrait done in less than two days,
including the coloring. This fact alone suggests two things:

1. I'm finally figuring out how I like my coloring, and
2. I have the ability to color in a short amount of time
after all.

However, this portrait is a very simple one with a minimal
color palette. It takes more time to color a single human
than a single animal and having a background also adds time.

I announced many weeks ago that I was willing to settle for
*not coloring everything* in the comic pages. However, after a
lot of thought and reflection, I want to give full-color a
try. When I start uploading pages for Book 2, **I will attempt
to upload them in full-color!**  

### Color and Rework

In addition to coloring Book 2, I'm *hoping* I can keep a
good-enough buffer to where I can begin reworking the pages
for Book 1. Don't get me wrong, I **treasure** the progress I
made as I drew those first few pages, but let's face it---some
things *need* fixing. Like the wolf, for example---I didn't ink
it black because I thought I was going to color it later (plus
I was scared of messing up a 'perfectly' well-drawn wolf).

Plus, I tried coloring Book 1 before as it is---bad idea.
Imagine yourself zooming in on something you drew as a kid
that you thought looked good at the time, but *now* you're
trying to color it. Now imagine doing that twenty times.
This was where the doubts about coloring came from. I knew
reworking the old pages would take a lot of work, but to add
on coloring *all of them?* The task still looks daunting.

BUT... Now I am able to color *good* line art with time to
spare. Maybe I *can* do this.

Therefore, I'm going to try out coloring pages to be
uploaded for the first time ever. Keep in mind, though, if the
schedule gets too much for me to handle, I'll just revert back
to black and white pages. Or take a break. We'll figure out
how we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.

### Thanks for Reading!

Please like the Morphic Facebook page! I like 'likes' a lot.

**Return next week to see another character portrait!** (I can't
guarantee that it will be in color, but it should be good
anyway!)
