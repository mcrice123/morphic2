    'The left side profile of the settler in black, visible from the shoulders, up, appears in the middle of the panel. He holds up his right hand in a contemplative gesture, with his thumb on his chin and his pointer finger under his nose. Above him, a montage of various animals appears against a backdrop of rainbow colors across the full width of the panel. Starting from the far left, the animals consist of a large black spider, an angry brown bear facing the spider with claws and teeth showing, a green snake with yellow markings on its head, and a brown chihuahua with beady black eyes.',

The top of the panel cuts off his forehead, under which the whites of his eyes and his teeth show brightly against his alarming glare. He peers slightly to the left, at something off-screen and he holds up a foot-long wooden peg in front of him, sharpened to a point. Stalks of wheat provide the backdrop for the panel and some of them appear in the foreground as well.',
