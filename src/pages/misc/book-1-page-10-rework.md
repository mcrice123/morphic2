# Welcome Back!

I hope you all had a great holiday season! Thanks to the month off from posting pages, 
I got more time and energy to focus on spending time with family and had a great time. 

Now that my break is over, I definitely feel more creative energy to work with...
_but not in the way I expected._

### Trial Run

I was feeling really motivated to color a Book 1 page last week, so I decided to jump on 
page 10--[**which is uploaded today, btw**](https://mcrice123.github.io/morphic/blog/book-1-page-10/)--since
it was _mostly_ finished anyway. I ended up reworking the ink some more on it, but I finished it easily. 

Then _this_ week I started drawing pages 33 and 34...and it took all I got just to finish the details 
of _one_ page. 

As soon as I finished page 33, I sat back to look at both pages, one fully drawn and the other barely started.
I sat like this for probably 10 minutes, just to figure out what I was feeling. I came to the conclusion 
that I'm still burnt out after my month-long break. _I'm just not motivated to draw new pages right now._ 

**However, it hit me that I'm actually excited about coloring Book 1 pages.** After drawing page 33, I felt 
_motivated_ to color another Book 1 page and it's nearly done as of writing this post! 

### Possible Reason for Burnout

I was a little stunned that I'm still not eager to continue Book 2 pages. I decided to look back at my upload 
history around this time of the year for comparison. 

You know what I found? **I barely took any breaks.** And when I did, it was out of dire necessity to study 
for finals week. That was basically it... I didn't take an intentional month-long break from updates since
_two years_ ago. **No wonder I'm burnt out.** 

### Planning for this year

I had in mind a month ago that I should plan on taking time off from drawing this year. **I still think that I 
should take a month off in June AND December**, just to see if it makes a difference in the work I produce. 
That means only 10 months to draw, but last year I made only 32 new (fully-colored) pages and 10 reworked/colored
Book 1 pages. That means **I produced 42 pages**, which is also roughly the **same total number of pages I'd produce if I were only working 10 months** out of the year (10 months * 4 pages a month = 40 pages). **And that's _without_ counting the miscellaneous posts, like the 'How I Draw' posts.**

Based off of these numbers and the results of my trial run, I think I have nothing to lose by planning for two months of break time this year. **It may even help prevent burnout in years to come---but we'll see.**

### As for weekly updates

**Since I'm _really_ motivated to keep coloring Book 1 pages, I'm going to upload _those_ on a weekly basis** 
and create miscellaneous posts to briefly compare/contrast the updated page and share the link to it. 
It sucks that I can't give new content right now, but there's no getting around this...'page block', 
whatever this is. 

I'm going to keep working on pages 33 and 34, but I'll be taking my sweet time on those. I think I'll 
reassess my 'creative state' again in March to figure out if I'm ready to start on weekly page updates 
for Book 2. **Worst case scenario, I go through most of this year just coloring Book 1 pages---really, 
that's not so bad.** I've been wanting to do those anyway, but I was expecting to do them b/w Book 2 pages. 
_Mrhh._  

At least I can look forward to this year making Book 1 look like what it does in my head. **_Actually, I_ am 
_looking forward to it..._**

# Final Thoughts until next week

Regardless of when I continue Book 2, **I still aim for 40 pages finished by the end of the year.** I'm 
accepting any combination of reworked pages and new pages to reach this goal. **_SO HERE GOES!_**

Have a great weekend and thanks for following! Feel free to like my Facebook page and reread the comic! See 
you next week!
