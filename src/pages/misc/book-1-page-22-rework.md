# Definitely needed to revise this page

I remember when I was finalizing the character design for Nascha. I felt so certain about the hair style 
I gave her. **Now, 2 years later, I look at this page and think that there's nothing quite like _time_ 
to curb one's style choices.**

So I changed Nascha's hair. I like how her bangs frame her face.  

### An important rule for text in comics

**The most jarring feature of this page were the walls of text.** I feel less bad about this cringe-worthy 
mistake, since it's apparently a common one made by artists new to drawing comics. 
And besides, the stuff that 
Nascha says in those walls of text wasn't supposed to convey any helpful information. It was meant to be 
mysterious and not well understood by design. 

That goal didn't change since I drew this page, but after 2 
years, I see the disadvantage of having all this text taking up whole panels: 
**There's no clear direction to the reader on how to interpret what is going on.**

 - Is someone talking?
 - Who is talking?
 - Where do I start reading?
 - [Reads it] _...Did I just waste five minutes reading redundant information?!_

The page makes more sense once Errie starts talking, but I knew it can do better. Therefore, I did away 
with the walls of text and created new speech bubbles. **Now, in addition to clarifying what Nascha is saying,
I'm introducing a _new_ mystery in the situation---the presence of _two kinds_ of speech bubbles.**

I'll leave it to the audience to figure out what this means, as the significance will be revealed by the
plot. In fact, you can find some hints in Book 2...

# Thanks for reading!

[Check out the rest of page 22!](https://mcrice123.github.io/morphic/blog/book-1-page-22/) 
**Next week I'll post another updated page, one that I'm _super_ proud of!**

Have a great weekend!
